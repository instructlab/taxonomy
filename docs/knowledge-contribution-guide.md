# Knowledge contribution guidelines 

You can create a Git repository to host your knowledge contributions anywhere (GitLab, Gerrit, etc.) but it may be favorable to create one on GitHub. The following instructions show you how to create a knowledge repository in GitHub and contribute to the taxonomy. 

## Prerequisites

- You have a GitHub account 
- You have a forked copy of the taxonomy repository 
- Verify that the model does not already know the knowledge you want to submit

## Creating your own knowledge repository 

To create a new GitHub repository, follow the GitHub documentation in [Creating a new repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository).

The specific steps are listed as follows:
1. In your GitHub profile page, navigate to the repositories tab. You will see a search bar where you can search your repositories, or create a new one. 
2. This takes you to a page titled “Create a new repository”. Create a custom name for your repository and add a README.md file. For example, “knowlege_contributions” could be a good name for your repository. 
3. Click “Create” when you are all set.

## Convert your knowledge documentation to markdown 

There are many online tools that can help you convert your documents to markdown. If you are using a wiki page for your contributions, you can use [pandocs](https://pandoc.org/try/) to convert the documents.

## Add the markdown file to your repository 

To add a file to your GitHub repository, follow the GitHub documentation in [Adding a file to a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/adding-a-file-to-a-repository).

The specific steps are listed as follows:
1. Navigate to “Add files”. Click “Create new file” if you want to manually add your markdown content. Click “Upload files” if you have a file locally to add. 
2. Add a description and commit your changes. 
    
    Since this is your own repository, you can commit directly to the `main` branch. 

3. You can then see your new content in your repository. 

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Make a note of your commit SHA, you need it for your `qna.yaml`.

## Create a pull request in the taxonomy repository 

Navigate to your forked taxonomy repository and ensure it is up-to-date.

There are a few ways you can create a pull request: 
- For details on the local process, check out [The GitHub Workflow Guide](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/guide/github-workflow.md) in the kubernetes documentation and the [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow) in the GitHub documentation.
- For details on contributing using the GitHub webpage UI, see [Contributing using the GH UI](https://github.com/instructlab/taxonomy/docs/contributing_via_GH_UI.md) or [Creating a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request?tool=webui) in the GitHub documentation.

## Verification

A few things to check before seeking reviews for your contribution: 

- Your `qna.yaml` follows the proper formatting. See examples in [Knowledge: YAML examples](https://github.com/instructlab/taxonomy/blob/main/README.md#knowledge-yaml-examples)
- Ensure all parameters are set. Especially the `document`, `repo`, `commit` and `pattern` keys; these parameters are specific to knowledge contributions and require more analysis.
- Include a `attribution.txt` file for citing your sources. see [For your attribution.txt file](https://github.com/instructlab/taxonomy/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#for-your-attributiontxt-file) for more information.
