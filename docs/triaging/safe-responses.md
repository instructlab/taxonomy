### Jokes and Poems
Thank you for taking the time to submit to InstructLab! I know this wasn't easy and could have been quite time-consuming. Unfortunately, our team has decided that submissions for jokes or poems (skills and knowledge) are no longer supported or approved. We received so many at the beginning, and with jokes being "in the eye of the beholder" and puns requiring nuance for native English speakers, we realized we were possibly unconsciously biasing our model. We have discovered that working with both topics has its own challenges, and if we want something generalized, finding consensus was unsuccessful. 

We have updated the [topics to avoid](https://github.com/instructlab/community/blob/main/docs/SKILLS_GUIDE.md#avoid-these-topics) to reflect this, and if you have more questions, don't hesitate to comment on this PR. We may revisit this in the future, but we are looking for unique skills or new knowledge for the model; poems and jokes, unfortunately, don't fit this plan. 

Thank you again for taking this time, and we are looking forward to your next PR to the InstructLab project!

### Math 
LLMs aren't great at counting, math, or computation. Right now we're not seeking to improve the model's math and computation ability as this skill belongs to ["core skill"](https://github.com/instructlab/community/blob/main/docs/SKILLS_GUIDE.md#core-skills), which is not open to contribution.

This will be rejected for now and we can reconsider if we open a math / computation taxonomy.

### Coding

Thanks for the submission! Coding belongs to ["core skill"](https://github.com/instructlab/community/blob/main/docs/SKILLS_GUIDE.md#core-skills), which is not open to contribution.

This will be rejected for now and we can reconsider if we open a programming / coding taxonomy.

### Knowledge not Skill
Given the content of the file, it seems that this would likely fall under knowledge, which we are currently accepting contributions for under different [guidlines](https://github.com/instructlab/taxonomy?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started-with-knowledge-contributions). 

Closing this PR, but feel free to re submit as knowledge following those guidelines!

## Contribution Formatting Guidlines
### Not Enough Examples
Could you please make sure there are five examples with good diversity? We have recently updated the [readme](https://github.com/instructlab/taxonomy/blob/main/README.md#getting-started-with-skill-contributions) with the new requirement. Thank you for your contribution!

### Attribution
Thanks for the submission! It looks interesting. Based on the [current guide](https://github.com/instructlab/taxonomy/blob/main/README.md#getting-started-with-skill-contributions), do you mind adding attribution to the examples?

### Mentions of GPT, ChatGPT, Bard, or other proprietary LLMs
Since this is a non-proprietary project, please remove all mentions of the names for commercial or proprietary LLM models; we are in favor of wordings like “LLMs”, or “Foundation Models”, etc.
