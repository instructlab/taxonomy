  - answer: "IBM Cloud Code Engine is a fully managed, serverless platform that runs\
      \ your containerized workloads, including web apps, micro-services,\
      \ event-driven functions, or batch jobs.\
      \ Code Engine even builds container images for you from your source code.\
      \ All these workloads can seamlessly work together because they are all hosted\
      \ within the same Kubernetes infrastructure.\
      \ The Code Engine experience is designed so that you can focus on writing code\
      \ and not on the infrastructure that is needed to host it.\n"
    question: 'What is Code Engine'
  - answer: "Some key terms are Projects, Applications, Jobs, and Functions"
    question: 'What are the key terms of Code Engine'
  - answer: "A project is a grouping of Code Engine entities such as\
    \ applications, jobs, and builds. Projects are used to manage resources\
    \ and provide access to its entities.\n"
    question: 'What is a Code Engine Project?'
  - answer: "An application, or app, runs your code to serve HTTP requests.\
    \ An application has a URL for incoming requests. \
    \ The number of running instances of an application are automatically scaled\
    \ up or down (to zero) based on incoming workload.\n"
    question: 'What is a Code Engine Application?'
  - answer: "A Function is a stateless code snippet that performs tasks in response to an HTTP request.\n"
    question: 'What is a Code Engine Function?'
  - answer: "A job runs one or more instances of your executable code in parallel.\
    \ Unlike applications, which include an HTTP Server to handle incoming requests,\
    \ jobs are designed to run one time and exit.\n"
