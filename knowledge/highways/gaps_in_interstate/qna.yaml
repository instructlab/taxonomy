    Interstate 70 is one-lane only in these following locations:
      - Interstate 70 in Kansas has only one lane for eastbound through traffic for several hundred feet in Kansas City where the highway approaches the Lewis and Clark Viaduct Bridge, which carries the highway over the Kansas River toward Kansas City, Missouri. Interstate 670, just a few blocks south provides an alternate route without this bottleneck.
      - Interstate 70 in West Virginia has only one lane for approximately one thousand feet in Wheeling,[16] where the highway enters the Wheeling Tunnel and crosses the Ohio River on the Fort Henry Bridge. Nearby I-470 provides relief from this situation.
  question: Where is Interstate 70 a one way highway?
