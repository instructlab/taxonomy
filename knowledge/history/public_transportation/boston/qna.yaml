      The [Cambridge Railroad](Cambridge_Railroad "wikilink") was the first
      [streetcar](Tram "wikilink") company in Massachusetts. It was chartered
      in 1853 to connect the [West End of
      Boston](West_End,_Boston,_Massachusetts "wikilink") to [Central
      Square](Central_Square_(Cambridge) "wikilink") and [Harvard
      Square](Harvard_Square "wikilink") in
      [Cambridge](Cambridge,_Massachusetts "wikilink") via the West End
      Bridge. (The bridge was replaced by the current [Longfellow
      Bridge](Longfellow_Bridge "wikilink") in early August 1906). This is the
      same route followed by today's [Red Line](Red_Line_(MBTA) "wikilink")
      subway, but on the surface street network. Using horse-drawn streetcars,
      the Cambridge Railroad started running on March 26, 1856. Another
      streetcar company, the [Dorchester
      Railroad](Dorchester_Railroad "wikilink"), was chartered in 1854. Over
      20 streetcar lines were laid down throughout the Boston area by these
      and other competing companies.

      In order to regulate fares and reduce competition, the General Court of
      Massachusetts passed the West End Consolidation Act to consolidate the
      rail line operations. This created the [West End Street
      Railway](West_End_Street_Railway "wikilink") in 1885. The company
      consolidated ownership of existing streetcar lines in Boston and the
      inner suburbs and began converting the animal-drawn vehicles to electric
      propulsion. The first electric trolleys ran in 1889, and the last
      [horsecar](horsecar "wikilink") went out of service around 1900.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What was the first streetcar company in Massachusetts?
        answer: |
          The Cambridge Railroad was the first streetcar company in
          Massachusetts.
      - question: |
          In 1856, what types of vehicals did the Cambridge Railroad use?
        answer: |
          Using horse-drawn streetcars, the Cambridge Railroad started
          running on March 26, 1856.
      - question: |
          When did Boston switch from animal-drawn vehicals to electric
          trolleys?
        answer: |
          The first electric trolleys ran in 1889, and the last horsecar
          went out of service around 1900.

      In 1965, the MBTA assigned colors to its four rapid transit lines and
      lettered the branches of the Green Line from north to south. However,
      shortages of streetcars, among other factors, eventually caused bus
      substitution of rail service on two branches of the Green Line. In 1969,
      the [A branch](Green_Line_A_branch "wikilink") was replaced by bus
      service in its entirety. In 1985, the portion of the [E
      branch](Green_Line_E_branch "wikilink") from [Heath
      Street](Heath_Street_(MBTA_station) "wikilink") to
      [Arborway](Forest_Hills_(MBTA_station) "wikilink") was replaced by
      buses.

      In 1968, the MBTA purchased bus routes in the outer suburbs to the north
      and south, from the [Eastern Massachusetts Street
      Railway](Eastern_Massachusetts_Street_Railway "wikilink"). Western
      suburban routes were purchased in 1972 from the [Middlesex and Boston
      Street Railway](Middlesex_and_Boston_Street_Railway "wikilink"). (Both
      of these companies had long since ceased running any streetcar service).
      A few routes to the north were taken over from Service Bus Lines in
      1975, and one in the south in 1980 from the Brush Hill Transportation
      Company. As with the commuter rail system, many of the outlying routes
      were dropped soon before or after the takeover, due to low ridership and
      high operating costs, and out-of-district communities' refusal to join
      or contract with the MBTA.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What year did the MBTA assign colors to its transit lines?
        answer: |
          In 1965, the MBTA assigned colors to its four rapid transit lines
          and lettered the branches of the Green Line from north to south.
      - question: What bus routes did the MBTA purchase in 1968?
        answer: |
          In 1968, the MBTA purchased bus routes in the outer suburbs to
          the north and south, from the Eastern Massachusetts Street
          Railway.
      - question: In the 1970s, why were MBTA commuter rail routes dropped?
        answer: |
          As with the commuter rail system, many of the outlying routes
          were dropped soon before or after the takeover, due to low
          ridership and high operating costs, and out-of-district
          communities' refusal to join or contract with the MBTA.

      In 1947, the newly formed Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) purchased
      and took over subway, elevated, streetcar, and bus operations from the
      [Boston Elevated Railway](Boston_Elevated_Railway "wikilink"). The
      original MTA district consisted of 14 cities and towns —
      [Arlington](Arlington,_Massachusetts "wikilink"),
      [Belmont](Belmont,_Massachusetts "wikilink"), Boston,
      [Brookline](Brookline,_Massachusetts "wikilink"),
      [Cambridge](Cambridge,_Massachusetts "wikilink"),
      [Chelsea](Chelsea,_Massachusetts "wikilink"),
      [Everett](Everett,_Massachusetts "wikilink"),
      [Malden](Malden,_Massachusetts "wikilink"),
      [Medford](Medford,_Massachusetts "wikilink"),
      [Milton](Milton,_Massachusetts "wikilink"),
      [Newton](Newton,_Massachusetts "wikilink"),
      [Revere](Revere,_Massachusetts "wikilink"),
      [Somerville](Somerville,_Massachusetts "wikilink"), and
      [Watertown](Watertown,_Massachusetts "wikilink").

      A state commission headed by Lieutenant Governor [Arthur W.
      Coolidge](Arthur_W._Coolidge "wikilink") published in 1947 an ambitious
      plan to replace private commuter rail services (which were losing money)
      with higher-frequency electric rapid transit that would run roughly out
      to what is now the [Massachusetts Route
      128](Massachusetts_Route_128 "wikilink") corridor. The goal was to shift
      commuters from automobiles and buses and deal with the "intolerable
      traffic conditions in downtown Boston". The MTA successfully
      implemented a few rapid transit expansions, but progress was slowed as
      automobile ownership increased and the [Federal-Aid Highway Act of
      1956](Federal-Aid_Highway_Act_of_1956 "wikilink") diverted many
      commuters off of mass transit.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What cities and towns did the original MTA consist of?
        answer: |
          The original MTA district consisted of 14 cities and
          towns — Arlington, Belmont, Boston, Brookline, Cambridge,
          Chelsea, Everett, Malden, Medford, Milton, Newton, Revere,
          Somerville, and Watertown.
      - question: What does MTA stand for?
        answer: The MTA stands for Metropolitan Transit Authority.

      Claims have been made by the Pioneer Institute that since 1988 the MBTA
      has been the fastest expanding transit system in the country, even as
      [Greater Boston](Greater_Boston "wikilink") has been the slowest growing
      metropolitan area. However, research by the Frontier Group finds
      that "no category has the MBTA been the “fastest-growing” of the
      nation's largest transit agencies, and in only two categories does it
      crack the top 10. However, the MBTA does crack the top 10 in another
      category: absolute growth in transit ridership."

      When, in 2000, the MBTA's income was capped, the agency began to run up
      large debts from already-scheduled projects and obligatory Big Dig
      remediation work. As of 2012, the MBTA has the highest debt of any transit
      authority in the United States. In an effort to compensate, rates were
      hiked on January 1, 2007, from $1.25 up to $2.00 per subway ride with a
      [CharlieTicket](CharlieCard "wikilink"), and $1.70 with a
      CharlieCard. Increasingly, local advocacy groups are calling on the
      state to assume $2.9 billion of the authority's debt, which totals
      approximately $9 billion. The interest on this debt is a large
      proportion of the MBTA's annual expenses, and severely limits funds
      available for any further required projects.

          per subway ride with a CharlieTicket, and $1.70 with a CharlieCard.
  - context: |
      On May 28, 2008, a westbound trolley on the [Green Line D
      branch](Green_Line_D_branch "wikilink") slammed into a stopped train
      between the [Waban](Waban_(MBTA_station) "wikilink") and
      [Woodland](Woodland_(MBTA_station) "wikilink") stations shortly after 6
      p.m. At least seven people were injured, and the operator of the moving
      train, Terrese Edmonds, 24, was killed. On May 8, 2009, two Green
      Line trolleys collided between [Park
      Street](Park_Street_station_(MBTA) "wikilink") and [Government
      Center](Government_Center_(MBTA_station) "wikilink") when the driver of
      one of them, 24-year-old Aiden Quinn, was [text
      messaging](text_messaging "wikilink") his girlfriend. A rule banning
      cell phones for operators while driving their bus, train, or streetcar
      was put into place days later.

      Immediately following the [Boston Marathon
      bombing](Boston_Marathon_bombing "wikilink"), the MBTA was partially
      shut down and National Guardsmen were deployed in various stations
      around the city. During the ensuing manhunt for Dzhokhar and
      Tamerlan Tsarnaev the MBTA was fully shut down until the stay-inside
      request for Watertown, Newton, Waltham, Cambridge, Belmont, and Boston
      was lifted. During the manhunt, MBTA buses were used to ferry police
      around the city. After the suspect was caught the MBTA resumed normal
      service. The next day the MBTA began displaying "BOSTON STRONG" and "WE
      ARE ONE BOSTON" on buses and subway cars, in addition to the destination
      that is normally displayed.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: Have MBTA trains ever collided?
        answer: |
          On May 8, 2009, two Green Line trolleys collided between Park
          Street and Government Center when the driver of one of them,
          24-year-old Aiden Quinn, was text messaging his girlfriend.
      - question: Has the MBTA ever completely shutdown?
        answer: |
          During the ensuing manhunt for Dzhokhar and Tamerlan
          Tsarnaev the MBTA was fully shut down until the stay-inside
          request for Watertown, Newton, Waltham, Cambridge, Belmont,
          and Boston was lifted.
      - question: |
          During the Boston Marathon Bomber manhunt, what were MBTA buses
          used for?
        answer: |
          During the manhunt, MBTA buses were used to ferry police around
          the city.
