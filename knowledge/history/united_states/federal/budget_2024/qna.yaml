      Improves Taxpayer Experience and Supports a Fair and Equitable Tax System. The Inflation Reduction Act addressed long-standing Internal Revenue Service (IRS) funding deficiencies by providing $79.4 billion in stable, long-term funding through 2031 to improve tax compliance by finally cracking down on high-income individuals and corporations who too often avoid paying their lawfully owed taxes and improving service for the millions of Americans that do pay their taxes. The funding will allow the IRS to modernize information technology infrastructure, administer new energy tax credits, and rebuild the administrative capacity of the Agency. To realize these goals and support timely and robust implementation of the important tax provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act, annual discretionary appropriations are necessary to maintain current services and allow the IRS to utilize the long-term funding for transformative modernization. To ensure that taxpayers receive the highest quality customer service and that all Americans are treated fairly by the U.S. tax system, the Budget provides a total of $14.1 billion for the IRS, $1.8 billion, or 15 percent, above the 2023 enacted level. This includes an increase of $642 million to improve the taxpayer experience and expand customer service outreach to underserved communities and the entire taxpaying public. The Budget also provides $290 million for IRS Business Systems Modernization, which did not receive annual funding in 2023, to continue and accelerate the development of new digital tools to enable better communication between taxpayers and the IRS.
