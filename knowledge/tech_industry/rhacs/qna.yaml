  - question: What is Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes?
    answer: |
        Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security (ACS) for Kubernetes is a security platform
        that helps organizations protect their Kubernetes environments by providing comprehensive visibility,
        security, and compliance controls.
  - question: How does Red Hat ACS enhance security in a Kubernetes environment?
    answer: |
        Red Hat ACS enhances security by offering features such as vulnerability management,
        runtime security, compliance enforcement, network segmentation, and configuration management
        , ensuring that Kubernetes clusters remain secure from development through deployment.
  - question: What are the key components of Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security?
    answer: |
        The key components include= Central - The management interface for visibility and
        policy enforcement. Sensor - Deployed on each Kubernetes cluster to collect
        data and enforce policies. Collector - Gathers runtime data from nodes and containers.
  - question: How does Red Hat ACS help with vulnerability management in Kubernetes?
    answer: |
        Red Hat ACS scans images and running containers for vulnerabilities, providing actionable
        insights to prioritize and remediate vulnerabilities based on their severity and exploitability.
  - question: What is the role of policy enforcement in Red Hat ACS?
    answer: |
        Policy enforcement in Red Hat ACS allows administrators to define and apply security
        policies that ensure compliance with organizational and regulatory standards, preventing the
        deployment of misconfigured or vulnerable containers.
  - question: Can Red Hat ACS integrate with existing CI/CD pipelines?
    answer: |
        Yes, Red Hat ACS can integrate with existing CI/CD pipelines to
        enforce security policies and perform vulnerability scanning at various stages of the
        software development lifecycle, ensuring security is maintained from development to production.
  - question: How does Red Hat ACS handle runtime security?
    answer: |
        Red Hat ACS provides runtime security by monitoring container activities, detecting anomalies
        , and blocking malicious behavior in real-time, thereby protecting running
        applications from threats.
  - question: What is network segmentation and how does Red Hat ACS implement it?
    answer: |
        Network segmentation involves dividing a network into smaller, isolated segments to improve
        security. Red Hat ACS implements network segmentation by defining and enforcing
        network policies that control traffic between pods and services, reducing the attack surface.
  - question: How does Red Hat ACS assist in achieving compliance?
    answer: |
        Red Hat ACS helps achieve compliance by providing continuous compliance checks, policy
        enforcement, and detailed reporting, ensuring that Kubernetes clusters adhere to
        industry standards and regulatory requirements.
