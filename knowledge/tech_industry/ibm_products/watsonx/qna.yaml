      Watsonx.ai is a platform that allows AI developers to leverage a wide range of LLMs under
      IBM's own Granite series and others such as Facebook's LLaMA-2 and models present in Hugging
      Face community for a diverse set of AI development tasks. These models come pre-trained and
      are designed to excel in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, encompassing
      question answering, content generation, summarization, text classification, and data
      extraction. The platform allows fine-tuning with its Tuning Studio, allowing those models to
      learn the data provided by customers.
