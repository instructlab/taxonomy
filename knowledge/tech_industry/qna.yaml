      How do I buy OpenShift Virtualization?
  - answer: >
      OpenShift Virtualization is a feature of Red Hat OpenShift that lets
      developers bring conventional VMs into workflows on OpenShift Container
      Platform. OpenShift Virtualization represents a continuation of Red Hat’s
      commitment to Kubernetes as the future of app orchestration and as a
      common standard across the hybrid cloud.

      OpenShift Virtualization is based on the upstream KubeVirt project, which 
      is a sandbox project in the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). While 
      in tech preview, OpenShift Virtualization was known as container-native virtualization.

      What is OpenShift Virtualizaion?
  - answer: >
      OpenShift Virtualization brings virtualized workloads directly into the
      development, deployment, and management workflows within OpenShift
      Container Platform. OpenShift Virtualization uses the Red Hat Enterprise
      Linux KVM hypervisor technology deployed using containers, allowing
      Kubernetes to deploy and manage VMs locally. This capability accelerates
      app modernization by

      Supporting development of new, microservices-based apps in containers that 
      interact with traditional virtualized apps.

      Combining virtualized workloads with container workloads on the same platform, 
      making it easier to gradually refactor monolithic, virtualized applications into containers.

      OpenShift Virtualization uses the KVM hypervisor, a core part of the Red Hat 
      Enterprise Linux kernel used by Red Hat Virtualization for more than a decade.

      OpenShift Virtualization is a feature of Red Hat OpenShift Container
      Platform and Red Hat OpenShift Kubernetes Engine. It is not an add-on or a
      separate product. The OpenShift Virtualization operator must be installed
      to access the feature. All current and future subscribers receive
      OpenShift Virtualization as part of their Red Hat OpenShift subscription.

      How will OpenShift Virtualization be made available?
  - answer: >
      New development is shifting to containers and serverless, but
      organizations have a huge investment in apps that run as virtual
      machines—many of which provide vital services to new and existing
      containerized applications. OpenShift Virtualization brings virtual
      machines to Red Hat OpenShift. This innovation allows developers and
      operations to develop, manage, and deploy virtual machines, containers,
      and serverless in one platform using the same tools and frameworks,
      accelerating their ability to deliver differentiated applications and
      services.

      OpenShift Virtualization lets customers modernize existing apps and services 
      to a single Kubernetesbased platform, Red Hat OpenShift. With this modernization, 
      customers can develop and deliver new and existing apps with VMs, containers, 
      and serverless functions managed together in a Kubernetes-native architecture. 
      Teams can also develop containerized apps faster by hosting VM-based workloads 
      on the same platform as container-based apps while continuing to use virtualized 
      applications where there are app dependencies.
    question: |
      What are the key customer benefits of OpenShift Virtualization?
  - answer: >
      OpenShift Virtualization helps technology teams modernize app
      development and optimize their IT infrastructure.

      Modernizing app development: In this use case, developers incorporate 
      existing apps and components into their workflows while simultaneously 
      building new, complex applications. OpenShift Virtualization lets teams 
      with conventional VM technology modernize, so they can develop containerized 
      apps faster. It also provides a way to refactor complex virtualized apps gradually 
      while continuing to run virtualized components. As developers modernize existing apps, 
      OpenShift Virtualization helps them run VMs in Kubernetes pods alongside normal 
      pods made up of app containers, all on OpenShift Container Platform. It supports 
      connectivity between app containers and VMs, while also letting VMs share networking 
      and storage infrastructure with app containers.


      Optimize IT infrastructure: As development teams embrace new workload footprints, 
      operations teams need efficient ways to manage them alongside existing investments. 
      OpenShift Virtualization helps optimize IT by providing a unified way to deploy, run, 
      and manage containerized and virtualized workloads on the same platform.
    question: |
      What are the key use cases for OpenShift Virtualization?
  - answer: >
      When OpenShift Virtualization operator is enabled for a Red Hat
      OpenShift cluster, developers can create and add virtualized applications
      to their projects using standard workflows, automation, and tools like
      GitOps. The resulting VMs run in parallel on the same Red Hat OpenShift
      nodes as standard application containers.
