  - context: |
        In August 2022, the President signed into law the CHIPS and Science Act (Public Law 117167)-historic bipartisan legislation that is helping power America's manufacturing boom and bringing supply chains-and jobs-back to the United States. The law serves as a down payment on the future of discovery that will create good-paying manufacturing jobs, support local economies and communities, connect regional industries with high-tech research and development, and bolster U.S. competitiveness globally. The CHIPS and Science Act, along with the Inflation Reduction Act, have sent clear signals to the private sector about the demand for clean energy and innovative technologies. In just the two years since the President took office, the Administration's actions have spurred more than $700 billion in private investment in manufacturing, utilities, and energy from more than 200 companies in all 50 States.

      Continues Implementation of the President's Historic Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Implementation of President's historic Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is already well underway. The Budget builds on this progress by providing a total of $76.1 billion for highway, highway safety, and transit formula programs, supporting the amounts authorized for year three of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. This includes $60.1 billion for the FederalAid Highway program, an increase of $1.3 billion compared to 2023 enacted, to continue repairing and upgrading the Nation's highways and bridges and build out a national network of electric vehicle chargers to help reach the President's climate goals-as well as $14 billion to support transit agencies across the Nation. The Budget also provides $4.6 billion for DOT to advance the Nation's most urgent and complex transportation infrastructure projects, in conjunction with the significant resources provided in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. These funds would support transformational projects that would increase safety, improve mobility for commuters and freight traffic, and spur shared economic growth. Building on the $1 billion provided in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for 2024 for operating and maintaining Army Corps of engineers-Civil Works program's (Corps) infrastructure, the Budget invests in the Corps' continued operations, maintenance, and improved reliability.

      Improves Taxpayer Experience and Supports a Fair and Equitable Tax System. The Inflation Reduction Act addressed long-standing Internal Revenue Service (IRS) funding deficiencies by providing $79.4 billion in stable, long-term funding through 2031 to improve tax compliance by finally cracking down on high-income individuals and corporations who too often avoid paying their lawfully owed taxes and improving service for the millions of Americans that do pay their taxes. The funding will allow the IRS to modernize information technology infrastructure, administer new energy tax credits, and rebuild the administrative capacity of the Agency. To realize these goals and support timely and robust implementation of the important tax provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act, annual discretionary appropriations are necessary to maintain current services and allow the IRS to utilize the long-term funding for transformative modernization. To ensure that taxpayers receive the highest quality customer service and that all Americans are treated fairly by the U.S. tax system, the Budget provides a total of $14.1 billion for the IRS, $1.8 billion, or 15 percent, above the 2023 enacted level. This includes an increase of $642 million to improve the taxpayer experience and expand customer service outreach to underserved communities and the entire taxpaying public. The Budget also provides $290 million for IRS Business Systems Modernization, which did not receive annual funding in 2023, to continue and accelerate the development of new digital tools to enable better communication between taxpayers and the IRS. In addition to annual discretionary funding, the Budget proposes to maintain deficit reducing Inflation Reduction Act-funded initiatives in 2032 and beyond. This pro
