  - context: Who invented cinema
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: Who invented the cinema?
        answer: >-
          No one person invented cinema. However, in 1891 the Edison Company
          successfully demonstrated a prototype of the Kinetoscope, which
          enabled one person at a time to view moving pictures.


          The first public Kinetoscope demonstration took place in 1893. By 1894
          the Kinetoscope was a commercial success, with public parlours
          established around the world.


          The first to present projected moving pictures to a paying audience
          were the Lumière brothers in December 1895 in Paris, France. They used
          a device of their own making, the Cinématographe, which was a camera,
          a projector and a film printer all in one.
      - question: What were early films like?
        answer: >-
          At first, films were very short, sometimes only a few minutes or less.
          They were shown at fairgrounds, music halls, or anywhere a screen
          could be set up and a room darkened. Subjects included local scenes
          and activities, views of foreign lands, short comedies, and newsworthy
          events.


          The films were accompanied by lectures, music, and extensive audience
          participation. Although they did not have synchronized dialogue, they
          were not ‘silent’ as they are sometimes described.
      - question: when was color added to films
        answer: >-
          Color was first added to black-and-white movies through hand coloring,
          tinting, toning, and stencilling.


          By 1906, the principles of colour separation were used to produce
          so-called ‘natural color’ moving images with the British Kinemacolor
          process, first presented to the public in 1909
  - context: Sound
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: When was sound added to films?
        answer: >+
          The first attempts to add synchronized sound to projected pictures
          used phonographic cylinders or discs.


          The first feature-length movie incorporating synchronised dialogue,
          The Jazz Singer (USA, 1927), used the Warner Brothers’ Vitaphone
          system, which employed a separate record disc with each reel of film
          for the sound.

      - question: |
          When was the golden age of cinema?
        answer: >-
          By the early 1930s, nearly all feature-length movies were presented
          with synchronized sound and, by the mid-1930s, some were in full color
          too. The advent of sound secured the dominant role of the American
          industry and gave rise to the so-called ‘Golden Age of Hollywood’.


          During the 1930s and 1940s, cinema was the principal form of popular
          entertainment, with people often attending cinemas twice a week.
          Ornate ’super’ cinemas or ‘picture palaces’, offering extra facilities
          such as cafés and ballrooms, came to towns and cities; many of them
          could hold over 3,000 people in a single auditorium.


          In Britain, the highest attendance occurred in 1946, with over 31
          million visits to the cinema each week.
      - question: How have attendance figures changed over the years of cinema?
        answer: >-
          While cinemas had some success in fighting the competition of
          television, they never regained the position and influence they held
          in the 1930s and 40s, and over the next 30 years audiences dwindled.
          By 1984 cinema attendances in Britain had declined to one million a
          week.


          By the late 2000s, however, that number had trebled. The first British
          multiplex was built in Milton Keynes in 1985, sparking a boom in
          out-of-town multiplex cinemas.


          Today, most people see films on television, whether terrestrial,
          satellite or subscription video on demand (SVOD) services. Streaming
          film content on computers, tablets and mobile phones is becoming more
          common as it proves to be more convenient for modern audiences and
          lifestyles.
