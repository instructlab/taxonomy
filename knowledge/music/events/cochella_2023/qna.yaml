- answer: Coachella 2023 took place over two weekends in mid-April 2023.
  question: In which month did Coachella 2023 occur?
- answer: On the final night of Weekend 1 of Coachella, there was uncertainty over whether headliner Frank Ocean would show up to the event. Despite his exclusion from the official YouTube livestream, Ocean began performing at 10:55 p.m., an hour later than his initial booking. He performed for an hour and a half, performing a rock version of his debut single "Novacane" (2011) that references Coachella, as well as reworked versions of several of his songs, such as "Bad Religion" off of Channel Orange (2012) and "White Ferrari" off of Blonde (2016). He then explained that his appearance was in honor of Ryan Breaux, his younger brother who died in a car crash in 2020.[2] Ocean abruptly ended his performance with a cover of The Isley Brothers' "At Your Best (You Are Love)" (1976), once covered by Aaliyah, informing the audience that it was curfew.[3] The performance was done through large video screens; the screens obscured Ocean and his band and were poorly lit. During the middle of the set, a DJ—later revealed to be DJ Crystallmess began playing, leading many fans to believe the show had concluded, before Ocean introduced her 15 minutes later, teasing Ocean's radio show Homer Radio.
