      InstructLab is an open-source project that focuses on improving Large
      Language Models (LLMs) by enabling community contributions. It addresses
      challenges like the need for specialized skills and extensive computing
      resources by offering a user-friendly interface. The project facilitates
      collaborative fine-tuning of LLMs, allowing developers and non-developers
      alike to contribute new knowledge or skills without dealing with the
      complexities of YAML structures or GitHub processes.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is the primary goal of InstructLab?
        answer: >-
          The primary goal of InstructLab is to improve Large Language Models
          (LLMs) through community contributions, making the process of
          fine-tuning and knowledge addition more accessible and collaborative.
      - question: How does InstructLab reduce complexity in fine-tuning LLMs?
        answer: >
          InstructLab reduces complexity by providing a user-friendly interface
          that eliminates the need for manually handling YAML structures or
          navigating GitHub pull requests, making it easier for a broader range
          of users to contribute.
      - question: What type of contributors can benefit from using InstructLab?
        answer: >-
          Both developers and non-developers can benefit from using InstructLab,
          as it allows them to contribute to LLMs without requiring extensive
          technical expertise in YAML or GitHub.
  - context: >-
      The "lab" in InstructLab stands for Large-Scale Alignment for ChatBots, a
      method used to ensure that LLMs are fine-tuned effectively with
      user-contributed knowledge and skills. This alignment is achieved through
      a process of generating synthetic data and creating taxonomies that help
      the models understand and categorize information better. LAB is designed
      to make models more efficient and accurate in handling specific tasks.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What does LAB stand for in InstructLab?
        answer: >-
          LAB stands for Large-Scale Alignment for ChatBots, which is the method
          used to align LLMs with user-contributed knowledge and skills.
      - question: How does the LAB method enhance the training of LLMs?
        answer: >-
          The LAB method enhances LLM training by using synthetic data
          generation and taxonomies to fine-tune models, ensuring they better
          understand and perform specific tasks.
      - question: What role do taxonomies play in the LAB method?
        answer: >-
          Taxonomies play a crucial role in the LAB method by organizing
          knowledge and skills into structured categories, making it easier for
          LLMs to align with the intended contributions and tasks.
  - context: >-
      The InstructLab User Interface (UI) simplifies the process of contributing
      to LLMs by providing an intuitive platform for adding knowledge or skills.
      Users can focus on the content of their contributions without worrying
      about technical aspects like YAML formatting or validation rules. This
      feature is particularly beneficial for users who are unfamiliar with
      GitHub processes or complex coding tasks.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: ' How does the InstructLab UI simplify the contribution process?'
        answer: >-
          The InstructLab UI simplifies the contribution process by providing an
          intuitive interface, allowing users to focus on their knowledge or
          skill contributions without handling technical tasks like YAML
          formatting or validation rules.
      - question: What type of users does the InstructLab UI cater to?
        answer: >-
          The InstructLab UI caters to a wide range of users, including those
          who may not be familiar with tools like GitHub or YAML, as well as
          more technically skilled developers.
      - question: What is one of the main benefits of using InstructLab UI?
        answer: >-
          One of the main benefits of using InstructLab UI is that it removes
          the complexity of manually managing YAML structures, making it easier
          for users to contribute knowledge and skills to the taxonomy
          repository.
  - context: >-
      InstructLab allows users to fine-tune open-source models like the IBM
      Granite and Merlinite models by contributing new knowledge. The process
      involves creating a markdown file with new information, adding it to the
      taxonomy, and generating synthetic data for training. Once the model is
      fine-tuned, users can verify its performance by asking questions based on
      the new knowledge contributed.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: Which models can be fine-tuned using InstructLab?
        answer: >-
          InstructLab allows users to fine-tune open-source models such as the
          IBM Granite model and the Merlinite model, which is a derivative of
          Mistral-7b.
      - question: What is required to fine-tune a model in InstructLab?
        answer: >-
          To fine-tune a model in InstructLab, users need to create a markdown
          file with new knowledge, add it to the taxonomy, generate synthetic
          data, and train the model with the updated information.
      - question: How can users verify that the model has been successfully fine-tuned?
        answer: >-
          Users can verify that the model has been successfully fine-tuned by
          chatting with it and asking questions related to the new knowledge.
          The improved responses indicate successful training.
