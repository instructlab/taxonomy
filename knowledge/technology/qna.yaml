- answer: Unless otherwise set forth in the applicable Purchasing Document,
    Supplier warrants that for a period of three (3) months following Acceptance
    Goods and Deliverables will conform to the specifications in the Purchasing Document and,
    to the extent there are no directly relevant specifications, to high industry standards.
    During the applicable warranty period, Supplier will test, remedy and/or replace, without charge to SFDC, any and all portions of any Deliverables or Goods which SFDC finds to be defective or non-conforming.
  question: What is the warranty that the Salesforce supplier needs to offer?
- answer: Supplier shall not subcontract any Services without the prior written consent of SFDC, which SFDC
    may grant or withhold in its sole discretion. If SFDC provides such written consent, then Supplier shall have the primary obligation to
    perform the Services, and shall be fully responsible for the performance of any subcontractor and the compliance with all of its
    obligations by any subcontractor. Supplier shall, in its contracts with all permitted subcontractors and agents in the provision of
    Services, flow down all of its obligations.
  question: What are subcontracting rules a Salesforce supplier should follow?
