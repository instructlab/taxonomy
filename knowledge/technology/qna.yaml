        Various automation tools in P2PaaS generate alerts and send them to the Slack channel
        #p2paas-awx-alerts. These alerts notify teams about issues in IBM Cloud, Kubernetes clusters,
        AWX jobs, and other automation processes. The team manually monitors these alerts
        and takes necessary actions based on severity.

       Each Slack alert is categorized based on severity levels:
            - High: Requires immediate action.
            - Medium: Should be addressed within the same day.
            - Low: Can be resolved in the coming days.
            AWX jobs also send automated Slack notifications for errors encountered during upgrades and change management.

      To improve efficiency, automation can be implemented for handling Slack
      alerts.
            Example automation steps include:
            - Parsing Slack alerts using a bot to extract key details.
            - Automatically categorizing alerts and assigning severity.
            - Triggering predefined remediation actions for common issues.
            - Notifying responsible teams only when manual intervention is needed.
            This helps reduce manual effort and ensures faster issue resolution.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: How can automation improve handling of Slack alerts?
        answer: >-
          By parsing alerts, categorizing severity, triggering remediation, and
          notifying teams when needed.
      - question: What role does a bot play in Slack alert automation?
        answer: >-
          It extracts key details, categorizes alerts, and triggers predefined
