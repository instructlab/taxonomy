      A key-value secret is a type of application secret that can be used to
      hold sensitive data that is structured as a JSON object. After you create
      the secret, you can use it to connect your application to a protected
      resource, such as a database or a third-party app.
            Your secret is stored securely in your dedicated Secrets Manager service instance, where you can centrally manage its lifecycle.

      In Secrets Manager, certificates that you import to the service are
      imported certificates (imported_cert). Certificates that you order through
      Secrets Manager from a third-party certificate authority are public
      certificates (public_cert).
            Certificates that you create by using a private certificate authority are private certificates (private_cert).
            Service credentials can hold Identity and Access Management issued credentials. The credentials can also be service-specific native credentials such as HMAC keys, a database user ID and password, SASL credentials, or TLS certificates.
