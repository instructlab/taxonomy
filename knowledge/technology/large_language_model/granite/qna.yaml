      IBM Granite is a series of decoder-only AI foundation models created by
      IBM. It was announced on September 7, 2023, and an initial paper was
      published 4 days later.

          IBM Granite is a series of decoder-only AI foundation models created
          by IBM.
      - question: When was IBM Granite announced?
        answer: September 7, 2023
      - question: What's a series of IBM decoder-only AI foundation models?
        answer: IBM Granite
  - context: >-
      Initially intended for use in the IBM's cloud-based data and generative AI
      platform Watsonx along with other models, IBM opened the source code of
      some code models. Granite models are trained on datasets curated from
      Internet, academic publishings, code datasets, legal and finance
      documents.

      IBM Granite is a series of decoder-only AI foundation models created by
      IBM. A foundation model is an AI model trained on broad data at scale.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is a foundation model?
        answer: AI model trained on broad data at scale
      - question: What is an example of foundation model from IBM?
        answer: IBM Granite
      - question: What is an AI model trained on broad data at scale from IBM?
        answer: 'answer: IBM Granite'
  - context: >-
      Granite's first foundation models were Granite.13b.instruct and
      Granite.13b.chat. The "13b" in their name comes from 13 billion, the
      amount of parameters they have as models, lesser than most of the larger
      models of the time. Later models vary from 3 to 34 billion parameters.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What are Granite's first foundation models?
        answer: Granite.13b.instruct and Granite.13b.chat
      - question: What does 13b in Granite.13b indicate?
        answer: The "13b" in their name comes from 13 billion parameters.
      - question: What are the latest models variations from Granite?
        answer: Later models vary from 3 to 34 billion parameters.

      On May 6, 2024, IBM released the source code of four variations of Granite
      Code Models under Apache 2, an open source permissive license.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: When has IBM released Granite Models as open source?
        answer: May 6, 2024
      - question: What are the open source license for IBM Granite models?
        answer: Apache 2
      - question: >-
          How many variations has IBM released as open source for Granite on
          6-May?
        answer: Four
