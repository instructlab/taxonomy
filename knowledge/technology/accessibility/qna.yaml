      Web accessibility evaluation tools are software programs or online
      services that help you determine if web content meets accessibility
      guidelines
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is AccessibilityChecker.org?
        answer: >-
          A free website accessibility automated scan for WCAG 2.1 compliance
          issues. Just insert your URL and get instant results.
      - question: 'What does AEL Accessibility Checker do? '
        answer: >-
          AEL Accessibility Checker (AAC) can quickly evaluate your web page
          against automated Accessibility violations.
      - question: 'What does Axe DevTools Linter do? '
        answer: >-
          axe DevTools Linter allows you to check your code for accessibility
          issues in your IDE and CI/CD. axe DevTools Linter is easy to configure
          and use, and it can check React (.js, .jsx, and .tsx), Vue (.vue),
          Angular (.component.html), HTML (.html and .htm), and Markdown (.md
          and .markdown) files so you can avoid common accessibility defects.

      Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 covers a wide range of
      recommendations for making Web content more accessible.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What are the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 used for?
        answer: >-
          Following these guidelines will make content more accessible to a
          wider range of people with disabilities, including accommodations for
          blindness and low vision, deafness and hearing loss, limited movement,
          speech disabilities, photosensitivity, and combinations of these, and
          some accommodation for learning disabilities and cognitive
          limitations; but will not address every user need for people with
          these disabilities. These guidelines address accessibility of web
          content on desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile devices. Following
          these guidelines will also often make Web content more usable to users
          in general.
      - question: What are the  success criteria used for?
        answer: >-
          WCAG 2.1 success criteria are written as testable statements that are
          not technology-specific. Guidance about satisfying the success
          criteria in specific technologies, as well as general information
          about interpreting the success criteria, is provided in separate
          documents.
      - question: What is a W3C Recommendation?
        answer: >-
          A W3C Recommendation is a specification that, after extensive
          consensus-building, is endorsed by W3C and its Members, and has
          commitments from Working Group members to royalty-free licensing for
          implementations.

      WAI-ARIA, the Accessible Rich Internet Applications Suite, defines a way
      to make Web content and Web applications more accessible to people with
      disabilities.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What are the benefits of using WAI-ARIA?
        answer: ' It especially helps with dynamic content and advanced user interface controls developed with HTML, JavaScript, and related technologies. Without WAI-ARIA certain functionality used in Web sites is not available to some users with disabilities, especially people who rely on screen readers and people who cannot use a mouse. WAI-ARIA addresses these accessibility challenges, for example, by defining ways for functionality to be provided to assistive technology. With WAI-ARIA, developers can make advanced Web applications accessible and usable to people with disabilities.'
      - question: What is WAI-ARIA?
        answer: >-
          WAI-ARIA provides a framework for adding attributes to identify
          features for user interaction, how they relate to each other, and
          their current state. WAI-ARIA describes navigation techniques to mark
          regions and common Web structures as menus, primary content, secondary
          content, banner information, and other types of Web structures. For
          example, with WAI-ARIA, developers can identify regions of pages and
          enable keyboard users to easily move among regions, rather than having
          to press Tab many times.
      - question: What does WAI-ARIA include?
        answer: >-
          WAI-ARIA includes technologies to map controls, live regions, and
          events to accessibility application programming interfaces (APIs),
          including custom controls used for rich Internet applications.
          WAI-ARIA techniques apply to widgets such as buttons, drop-down lists,
          calendar functions, tree controls (for example, expandable menus), and
          others.
  - context: 'Essential Components of Web Accessibility '
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: >-
          What are the key web development and interaction components that need
          to work together to make the web accessible for people with
          disabilities?
        answer: |
          These components include:
           content - the information in a web page or web application, including:
                  natural information such as text, images, and sounds
                  code or markup that defines structure, presentation, etc.
              web browsers, media players, and other “user agents”
              assistive technology, in some cases - screen readers, alternative keyboards,   switches, scanning software, etc.
              users’ knowledge, experiences, and in some cases, adaptive strategies using the web
              developers - designers, coders, authors, etc., including developers with disabilities and users who contribute content
              authoring tools - software that creates websites
              evaluation tools - web accessibility evaluation tools, HTML validators, CSS validators, etc.
      - question: How the Components Relate?
        answer: >-
          Web developers usually use authoring tools and evaluation tools to
          create web content.


          People (“users”) use web browsers, media players, assistive
          technologies, or other “user agents” to get and interact with the
          content.
      - question: >-
          Could you explain how the various components of a webpage, especially
          alt text for images, interact to ensure web accessibility
        answer: |2

              technical specifications address alternative text (for example, HTML defines the alternative text attribute (alt) of the image element (img))
              WAI guidelines (WCAG, ATAG, UAAG described below) - define how to implement alternative text for accessibility in the different components
              developers provide the appropriate alternative text wording
              authoring tools enable, facilitate, and promote providing alternative text in a web page
              evaluation tools are used to help check that alternative text exists
              user agents provide human and machine interface to the alternative text
              assistive technologies provide human interface to the alternative text in various modalities
              users know how to get the alternative text from their user agent and/or assistive technology as needed
  - context: >-
      Understanding documents provide detailed explanations for Web Content
      Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) guidelines and success criteria.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What does Guideline 1.1 Text Alternatives say?
        answer: >-
          Provide text alternatives for any non-text content so that it can be
          changed into other forms people need, such as large print, braille,
          speech, symbols or simpler language.
      - question: What is the purpose of  Time-based Media?
        answer: >
          The purpose of this guideline is to provide access to time-based and
          synchronized media.This includes media that is:

              audio-only
              video-only
              audio-video
              audio and/or video combined with interaction
      - question: What is the purpose of  Adaptable?
        answer: >-
          The purpose of this guideline is to ensure that all information is
          available in a form that can be perceived by all users, for example,
          spoken aloud, or presented in a simpler visual layout. If all of the
          information is available in a form that can be determined by software,
          then it can be presented to users in different ways (visually,
          audibly, tactilely etc.). If information is embedded in a particular
          presentation in such a way that the structure and information cannot
          be programmatically determined by the assistive technology, then it
          cannot be rendered in other formats as needed by the user.
