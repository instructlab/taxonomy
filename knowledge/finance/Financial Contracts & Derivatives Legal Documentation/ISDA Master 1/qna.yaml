  The ISDA 2002 Master Agreement establishes the legal and credit terms between parties, including definitions, obligations, payment terms, and termination provisions.
  The agreement covers tax representations, document delivery requirements, and dispute resolution mechanisms. It also includes provisions for netting,
  governing law, confidentiality, and liability limitations. Specific schedules and annexes define party-specific terms, credit support arrangements,
  and commodity transactions. The document ensures consistency across multiple transactions, reducing legal uncertainty and credit risk.
