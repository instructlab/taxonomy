  - question: What is a Gibson Les Paul Studio guitar?
    answer: >
      The Gibson Les Paul Studio is a solid body electric guitar produced by
      the Gibson Guitar Corporation since 1983. It is a model of Les Paul with
      some features omitted to appeal to musicians looking for the tonal
      qualities of the guitar but with less of an emphasis on cosmetics and to
      reduce the price of the instrument.
  # - question: When did Gibson introduce the Les Paul Studio to their lineup?
  #   answer: >
  #     Responding to a gap in their model lineup for a lower-priced Les Paul in
  #     1983, Gibson introduced the Studio model.
  # - question: What is the difference between a Les Paul and a Les Paul Studio guitar?
  #   answer: >
  #     In order to produce a lower-cost Les Paul, features such as body binding,
  #     neck binding, and headstock inlays were not available. Additionally, the
  #     body was ⅛ to ¼ inch thinner than a standard Les Paul.
  # - question: What type of wood is the body of Les Paul Studio made from?
  #   answer: >
  #     Initially made of alder from 1983–1985, Gibson moved back to maple top/mahogany
  #     body combination after the alder body proved prone to lacquer problems.
  - question: >
      What woods have been used to make Les Paul Studio Custom or Les Paul Studio
      Standard models of guitars?
    answer: >
      The "Studio" name was used with Custom and Standard models which used
      non-traditional woods for the neck, body, top, and fingerboard. For example,
      Standard model bodies were made entirely from alder wood between 1983-1985,
      but Gibson later moved back to a mahogany body with a maple top after
      the alder body proved prone to lacquer problems.
  - question: Where did the name \"Studio\" in Les Paul Studio come from?
    answer: >
      The name Studio comes from the idea that this model would be sonically
      indistinguishable from a Les Paul Standard or Custom in the recording studio,
      and that the flashier guitars would be reserved for stage use.
