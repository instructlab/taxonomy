  - question: What is a Gibson Les Paul Studio guitar?
    answer: |
      The Gibson Les Paul Studio is a solid body electric guitar produced by
      the Gibson Guitar Corporation since 1983. It is a model of Les Paul with
      some features omitted to appeal to musicians looking for the tonal
      qualities of the guitar but with less of an emphasis on cosmetics and to
      reduce the price of the instrument.
  - question: When did Gibson introduce the Les Paul Studio to their lineup?
    answer: |
      Responding to a gap in their model lineup for a lower-priced Les Paul in
      1983, Gibson introduced the Studio model.
  - question: What is the difference between a Les Paul and a Les Paul Studio guitar?
    answer: |
      In order to produce a lower-cost Les Paul, features such as body binding,
      neck binding, and headstock inlays were not available. Additionally, the
      body was ⅛ to ¼ inch thinner than a standard Les Paul.
  - question: What type of wood is the body of Les Paul Studio made from?
    answer: |
      Initially made of alder from 1983–1985, Gibson moved back to maple top/mahogany
      body combination after the alder body proved prone to lacquer problems.
  - question: Where did the name Studio come from?
    answer: |
      The name "Studio" comes from the idea that this model would be sonically
      indistinguishable from a Les Paul Standard or Custom in the recording studio,
      and that the flashier guitars would be reserved for stage use.
