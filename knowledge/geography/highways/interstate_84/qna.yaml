  - question:
      What are some notable geographical features and landmarks
      along Interstate 84's route?
    answer:
      Interstate 84 passes through the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania and
      crosses the Delaware and Neversink rivers in New York. It also intersects
      with major roads like the New York State Thruway (I-87) and the Taconic
      State Parkway in New York. In Connecticut, it crosses the Housatonic River
      on the Rochambeau Bridge and the Connecticut River on the Bulkeley Bridge.
  - question:
      How does Interstate 84 contribute to transportation between major
      cities in the Northeast?
    answer:
      Interstate 84 serves as a crucial route between New York City and
      Boston, passing through major cities like Hartford, Connecticut. It
      provides a high-speed connection for both passenger and commercial
      traffic, facilitating travel and commerce between these metropolitan
      areas.
  - question:
      What historical and developmental challenges did Interstate 84 face in
      its construction and expansion?
    answer:
      Interstate 84 faced challenges in its original proposed route,
      particularly in Rhode Island due to environmental concerns about its
      impact on the Scituate Reservoir. Additionally, widening projects in
      Waterbury, Connecticut, experienced cost overruns, delays, and
      construction defects, leading to investigations and legal actions.
  - question:
      How did Interstate 86 relate to Interstate 84 in Connecticut and
      Massachusetts?
    answer:
      Interstate 86 was a designation used for a section of Interstate 84
      between East Hartford, Connecticut, and Sturbridge, Massachusetts. It was
      signed in the late 1970s and early 1980s but was later redesignated as
      I-84 in 1984. The renumbering also affected adjacent roads like I-384 and
      US 6.
  - question:
      Are there any tolls associated with Interstate 84?
    answer:
      Generally, Interstate 84 does not have tolls, except for the
      Newburgh–Beacon Bridge crossing the Hudson River in New York, which
      carries an eastbound-only toll for passenger vehicles. Additionally, there
      were tolls on I-84 in New York from 1992 to 2006, managed by the New York
      State Thruway Authority, before being transferred back to NYSDOT.
