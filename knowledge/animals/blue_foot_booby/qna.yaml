    question: What is the coutship ritual of a blue-footed booby
  - answer: |
      The blue-footed booby lays one to three eggs in one nest at a time, although 80% of nests only contain two eggs.
      Eggs are laid five days apart. After the first egg is laid, it is immediately incubated, which results in a
      difference in chick hatching times. The first chick hatches four days before the other, so it receives a
      four-day head start in growth compared to its younger sibling. This asynchronous hatching serves many purposes.
      First, it spaces out the difficult time period in rearing during which newborn chicks are too feeble to
      accept regurgitated food. In addition, it reduces the chance that parents will suffer total brood loss to
      predators such as the milk snake
