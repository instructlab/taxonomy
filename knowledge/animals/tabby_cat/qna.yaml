 - answer: |
      The orange tabby, also commonly called red or ginger tabby,
      is a color-variant of the above patterns, having pheomelanin
      (O allele) instead of eumelanin (o allele). Though generally
      a mix of orange and white, the ratio between fur color varies,
      from a few orange spots on the back of a white cat to a
      completely orange coloring with no white at all.
      The orange areas can be darker or lighter spots or stripes,
      but the white is nearly always solid and usually appears on
      the underbelly, paws, chest, and muzzle.
      Orange is a colloquial term used to describe an orange tabby cat.
      Many orange tabby owners make jokes about the silliness of their
      cats. They often say all orange tabby cats share a singular brain
      cell.
