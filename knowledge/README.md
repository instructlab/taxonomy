# Instructlab (LAB) Knowledge 

Knowledge consists of data and facts and is backed by documents. When you create knowledge for a model, you're giving it additional data to more accurately answer questions. The knowledge document formats currently supported are markdown (.md) and text (.txt).

Each `qna.yaml` file is required to contain a minimum of five question-answer pairs. The `qna.yaml` format should include the following mandatory fields:

* `seed_examples` (five or more examples sourced from the provided knowledge documents)
* `created_by` (your GitHub username)
* `task_description` (description of your knowledge)
* `domain` (your knowledge category)
* `document` (source of your knowledge contribution)
