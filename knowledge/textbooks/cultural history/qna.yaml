- answer: Isaak Dahle, a successful businessman from Chicago, played a pivotal role
    in the establishment and development of Little Norway. After being inspired by
    Norwegian farms during a European tour in 1926, he purchased a small run-down
    farm west of Mt Horeb in 1927, intending it to be a summer retreat for his friends
    and family. Over the next few years, he hired craftsmen to renovate the property
    into an idyllic Norwegian farm, advertised locally for ethnic antiques, and commissioned
    a Chicago interior decorator to ship crates of artifacts from Norway. In 1933,
    he purchased the Norway Pavilion from the 1893 Chicago World's Fair and had it
    moved to his summer retreat, which led to the opening of Little Norway to the
    public in 1934.
  question: What was the role of Isaak Dahle in the establishment and development
    of Little Norway?
- answer: '''Rosemaling'' plays a significant role in the cultural history of the
    Norwegian-American community as it is a traditional art form that has been used
    to express identity, share heritage, and recontextualize objects within the community.
    By applying rosemaling to various items, such as chairs, dresses, and paintings,
    Norwegian-Americans have transformed utilitarian objects into artistic expressions
    of their cultural background and personal identity. This practice has helped maintain
    and celebrate cultural traditions while adapting to new contexts and generations.'

    community?
- answer: Craftsmen played a crucial role in the development of Little Norway. Isaak
    Dahle hired carpenters, painters, and stone masons to renovate the property into
    an idyllic Norwegian farm. Many of these craftsmen, like painters Per Lysne and
    Olaf Colberson, were of Norwegian descent and helped create an authentic Norwegian
    atmosphere. They constructed rustic log furniture from trees on the property and
    made plain antiques 'more Norwegian' with the application of ethnic decoration.
    Their work significantly contributed to the site's appeal by introducing nature
    to the home through its rustic, natural finish and simple, plantlike structure,
    resonating with both ideals of natural beauty and tranquility as well as contemporary
    home fashions with its class implications.
  question: What was the role of craftsmen in the development of Little Norway, and
    how did their work contribute to the site's appeal?
