- answer: To find the number of earthquake points within 500 US Survey Miles of a
    convergent plate boundary, you would need to follow the instructions provided
    in the document to run a definition query on the PlateBoundary layer to only show
    convergent plate boundaries, and then use the Select By Location tool to select
    earthquake points within a specified distance of the convergent plate boundaries.
    Once you have completed these steps, you can find the number of selected earthquake
    points by opening the attribute table for the Earthquakes1900 layer and looking
    at the number of records displayed.
  question: Q9. How many earthquake points are within 500 US Survey Miles of a convergent
    plate boundary?
- answer: The "Go To XY" tool in ArcGIS Pro is used to navigate to specific geographic
    coordinates on the map. In the context of correcting problematic address matches,
    this tool can be used to find the correct location of an airport or helipad using
    its latitude and longitude, and then manually click on a location on the map to
    match it to the correct location.
  question: What is the purpose of the "Go To XY" tool in ArcGIS Pro and how is it
    used in the context of correcting problematic address matches?
- answer: While the Data Enrichment > Enrich Layer tool in ArcGIS Online can be a
    useful tool for analyzing the relationship between income and 100-year floodplain
    locations, there are several limitations to consider. First, the income data used
    in the enrichment process is based on estimates and may not accurately reflect
    the true income distribution within each floodplain polygon. Additionally, the
    enrichment process may not account for important factors that could influence
    income, such as the size and composition of households, the availability of affordable
    housing, and the presence of local job markets. Finally, the enrichment process
    may not capture the dynamic nature of income and flood risk, as both of these
    factors can change over time due to a variety of economic, social, and environmental
    factors.
  question: What are some limitations of using the Data Enrichment > Enrich Layer
    tool in ArcGIS Online to analyze the relationship between income and 100-year
    floodplain locations?
