      Thomas Penson Quincey was born at 86 Cross Street, Manchester,
      Lancashire.  His father was a successful merchant with an interest in
      literature. Soon  after Thomas's birth, the family moved to The Farm and
      then later to  Greenheys, a larger country house in Chorlton-on-Medlock
      near Manchester.  In 1796, three years after the death of his father,
      Thomas Quincey, his  mother – the erstwhile Elizabeth Penson – took the
      name De Quincey. That  same year, his mother moved to Bath and enrolled
      him at King Edward's School.  He was a weak and sickly child. His youth
      was spent in solitude, and when his  elder brother, William, came home, he
      wrought havoc in the quiet surroundings.  De Quincey's mother was a woman
      of strong character and intelligence but seems  to have inspired more awe
      than affection in her children. She brought them up  strictly, taking De
      Quincey out of school after three years because she was  afraid he would
      become big-headed, and sending him to an inferior school at  Wingfield,
      Wiltshire.

      In 1821, he went to London to produce some translations of German authors,
      but  was persuaded first to write and publish an account of his opium
      experiences,  which that year appeared in the London Magazine. His account
      proved to be a new  sensation that eclipsed interest in Lamb's Essays of
      Elia, which were then  appearing in the same periodical. The Confessions
      of an English Opium-Eater  were soon published in book form. De Quincey
      then made a number of new literary  acquaintances. Thomas Hood found the
      shrinking author "at home in a German  ocean of literature, in a storm,
      flooding all the floor, the tables and the  chairs—billows of books..." De
      Quincey was a famed conversationalist.

      Along with his opium addiction, debt was one of the primary constraints of
      De  Quincey's adult life. De Quincey came into his patrimony at the age of
      21, when he  received £2,000 (equivalent to £204,870 in 2023) from his
      late father's estate. He  was unwisely generous with his funds, making
      loans that could not or would not be  repaid, including a £300 loan to
      Coleridge in 1807. After leaving Oxford without a  degree, he made an
      attempt to study law, but desultorily and unsuccessfully; he had  no
      steady income and spent large sums on books (he was a lifelong collector).
      By the  1820s he was constantly in financial difficulties. More than once
      in his later years,  De Quincey was forced to seek protection from arrest
      in the debtors' sanctuary of  Holyrood in Edinburgh. (At the time,
      Holyrood Park formed a debtors' sanctuary; people  could not be arrested
      for debt within those bounds. The debtors who took sanctuary  there could
      emerge only on Sundays, when arrests for debt were not allowed.) Yet De
      Quincey's money problems persisted; he got into further difficulties for
      debts he  incurred within the sanctuary.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: 'Aside from his addiction to opium, what is another challenge he faced?'
        answer: Debt
      - question: Why did De Quincey fall into debt?
        answer: 'He was too generous, and he collected books his entire life.'
      - question: What consequences did he face from his debt?
        answer: He had to seek protection in a debtors' sanctuary.

      By his own testimony, De Quincey first used opium in 1804 to relieve his
      neuralgia;  he used it for pleasure, but no more than weekly, through
      1812. It was in 1813 that  he first commenced daily usage, in response to
      illness and his grief over the death  of Wordsworth's young daughter
      Catherine. During 1813–1819 his daily dose was very  high, and resulted in
      the sufferings recounted in the final sections of his  Confessions. For
      the rest of his life, his opium use fluctuated between extremes; he  took
      "enormous doses" in 1843, but late in 1848 he went for 61 days with none
      at all.  There are many theories surrounding the effects of opium on
      literary creation, and  notably, his periods of low use were literarily
      unproductive. From 1842 until 1859  he spent long periods in a cottage
      near Midfield House south of Lasswade, assembling  his writings in the
      peace of the countryside.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: Why did De Quincey start using opium?
        answer: To relieve his neuralgia
      - question: When did De Quincey start using opium daily?
        answer: '1813'
      - question: What was De Quincey's view of his addiction to opium?
        answer: He lamented the suffering it caused him.
