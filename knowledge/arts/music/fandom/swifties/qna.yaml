      Critics have opined that Swift has redefined artist–fandom relationships
      by establishing an intimate connection with Swifties. She has frequently
      engaged with, helped, credited and prioritized her fans, who have
      offered unprecedented support and interest in her works irrespective of
      her wavering reception in the media. They continued to support Swift
      through her genre transitions, unexpected artistic pivots, and her
      highly publicized controversies such as the 2019 masters dispute, while
      instigating the political scrutiny of Ticketmaster that led to
      implementation of various laws and stimulated economic growth with the
      Eras Tour. Swift's releases, promotional efforts, and fashion have
      garnered attention for incorporating Easter eggs and clues that are
      decoded by Swifties and considered part of her musical universe.

      Cultural analyses have variably described Swifties as a community of
      interest, a subculture, and a near-metaverse, while academics have
      studied them for their consumerism, content creation, social capital,
      collective effervescence, organizing prolificacy, and interpersonal
      relationships. The word Swiftie(s) was added to the Oxford Dictionary of
      English in 2023. Swifties have also been a subject of criticism, with
      some fans displaying disregard for Swift's privacy by publicizing her
      real-time locations and engaging in verbal attack of individuals,
      including celebrities, who malign Swift. On the other hand, some
      Swifties criticize Swift for her lifestyle and professional choices,
      which journalists disapprove as a parasocial relationship.
