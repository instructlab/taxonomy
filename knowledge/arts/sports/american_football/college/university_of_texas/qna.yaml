      Texas has a long-standing rivalry with the University of Oklahoma. The
      football game between the University of

      Texas and Oklahoma is commonly known as the "Red River Rivalry" and is
      held annually in Dallas at the Cotton

      Bowl. Dallas is used as a "neutral site" since it is approximately midway
      between the two campuses.  The stadium

      is split, with each team having an equal number of supporters on each side
      of the 50 yard line.  Texas state

      flags fly around the Longhorn end of the stadium and Oklahoma state flags
      fly around the Sooner end.  This

      border rivalry is often considered to be one of the top five current
      rivalries in the NCAA.  The Red River

      Shootout originated in 1900, while Oklahoma was still a territory of the
      United States, and it is the

      longest-running college-football rivalry played on a neutral field. Since
      2005, the football game has received

      sponsorship dollars in return for being referred to as the "SBC Red River
      Rivalry" (changed to AT&T Red River

      Rivalry in 2006 after SBC merged with AT&T), a move which has been
      criticized both for its commercialism and its

      political correctness.  The University of Texas holds its annual
      Torchlight Parade during the week of the Red

      River Rivalry. In 2005, the Dallas Morning News did an opinion poll of the
      119 Division 1A football coaches as

      to the nations top rivalry game in college football.  The Texas-OU game
      was ranked third. The game typically has

      conference or even national significance. Since 1945, one or both of the
      two teams has been ranked among the top

      25 teams in the nation coming into 60 out of 65 games. Twice Texas has
      defeated the

      Sooners a record eight straight times from 1940 to 1947 and 1958–1965.
      One of the most significant meetings was

      in 1963 with Oklahoma ranked No. 1 and Texas ranked No. 2, the game won by
      Texas 28–7 en route to their first

      officially recognized national championship.  The series has also had its
      share of games that came down to the

      wire and comebacks most recently in 2021 which saw sixth-ranked Sooners
      rallying from a 21-point first-quarter

      deficit to edge the 21st-ranked Longhorns 55–48 in the highest-scoring
      game in the rivalry.

      Glasscock came from NC State in 2021 as

      combination of duties between

      recruiting and player personnel.  On the recruiting side, Taylor Searels

      standpoint to accommodate recruiting visits.  In player personnel, JM
      Jones and Austin Shelton are assistant

      directors of player personnel, handling offense and defense respectively.

      They manage a team of recruiting assistants that all manage a position and
      report to their position coach.

      This recruiting assistant program has been a robust program that has seen
      the likes of Daniel Bernstein - EDGE,

      Julian Rowe-Cohen - TEs, Maxwell Solman - OL, Jacob De Santos - DB, Jake
      Warren - WR, and Tanner Martin - QBs

      that found most of the players on the

      team before anyone else.
