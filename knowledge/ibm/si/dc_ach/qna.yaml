    answer: >
      The Call Home feature benefits administrators with proactive monitoring,
      support for faster issue resolution, and minimized downtime.
  - question: >-
      What types of data are sent to IBM support through the "Call Home"
      feature?
    answer: >
      The Call Home feature sends diagnostic info, error logs, performance
      metrics, and configuration details to IBM support.
  - question: >-
      Is the data transmitted by the Call Home feature encrypted, and if so,
      how?
    answer: >
      The data transmitted by Call Home is encrypted using HTTPS with TLS for
      secure communication.
  - question: >-
      Can administrators control which data is sent through the "Call Home"
      feature in IBM Storage Insights?
    answer: >
      Yes, administrators can configure data types and amounts sent via Call
      Home in IBM Storage Insights.
  - question: How does IBM Storage Insights use performance metrics metadata?
    answer: >
      IBM Storage Insights uses performance metrics to analyze system
      performance, identify bottlenecks, and optimize resource use.
