        2. Detection using FCM Drive Statistics
        3. Detection using Signals generated by FCM4
  - question: >-
      Does Storage Insights Support Ransomware Threat Detection for DS8K
      devices.
    answer: >
      No Ransomware Threat Detection is supported only for IBM Storage
      Virtualize and IBM FlashSystem only.

  - question: What is Detection using Volume Statistics and how it works?
    answer: >
      This model works with IBM Storage Virtualize and FlashSystem (8.6.0+), on
      any volume type, using compression variations to detect anomalies.
  - question: What is Detection using Signals generated by FCM4 and how it works?
    answer: >

      I have mix of FCM4 and other FCM type drives on my storage system, Can I
      have inline threat detection alerts possible.
    answer: >
      Ransomware inline Threat detection alert is possible only if the mdisk is

  - question: >-
      How can I disable Ransomware Threat detection on one of my Storage Systems
      in Storage Insights
    answer: >
      Disable Ransomware Threat Detection: Go to Resources > Block Storage
      Systems, right-click the device, select Ransomware Threat Detection,
      disable, and save changes.
  - question: >-
      What are the validations that I can do to qualify if the alert is false
      positive or not
    answer: >
      Ransomware alerts can be false positives if the workload mimics
      ransomware. Validate by performing IO operations. If data is accessible,
      it's a false positive.

      Admins should confirm at the system/application level.
  - question: What steps I can perform once the alert is cateogrised as false positive.
    answer: >
      User can acknowledge the alert and the volume for which the alert is
      raised.

      Next probe would clear the Ransomware status on the Resources.
  - question: >-
      How would my snapshots are treated in Storage Insights once the alert is
      raised on the volume.
    answer: >
      Snapshots created post-alert are compromised. Check the L3 page > Copy
      Data > Volume Snapshot table for the compromised status.
  - question: >-
      Where I can find the Volumes marked as compromised once the Ransomware
      alert is raised on the Storage device
    answer: >
      Snapshots created after an alert are compromised. Check the L3 page > Copy
      Data > Volume Snapshot table for the security status.
  - question: >-
      Once the alert is raised are all the volumes snaphosts on the storage
      device are marked as compromised.
    answer: >
      Only volumes with alerts are affected. Snapshots created post-alert are
      compromised. Check L3 page > Copy Data > Volume Snapshot table for status.
  - question: >-
      Is it possible to customize the additional ransonmware alerting conditions
      as per my requirements for my storage insights tenants.
    answer: >
      You can't customize Ransomware conditions for your tenant. For changes,
      please raise an RFE request.
