In all written and external communications, when we are talking about OpenShift generally, we will use the term "Red Hat OpenShift" (the family name for the OpenShift brand). We will not use the name of a particular product offering (like “Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform”, for example), unless the context requires reference to that specific product or when messaging around a specific add-on like Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security. 


For questions and feedback, [fill out this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfqtC602uG5SfzkMptmTW5-HF82iGlJRIa0OV9uveC0B4G51Q/viewform), and the Hybrid Platforms Product Marketing team will consider and discuss your suggestion! 


**Executive summary**


Red Hat OpenShift is the leading modern application platform that provides a **trusted**, **comprehensive**, and **consistent **experience, fostering organizational and IT growth and innovation through its security-first, scalable application development and delivery capabilities.


At its foundation, Red Hat OpenShift is built on a trusted container engine that delivers a scalable approach to security and reliability for critical applications. With its comprehensive set of tools and services, Red Hat OpenShift streamlines the entire lifecycle of application development—from building and deploying to running and managing. It helps simplify the complexities of application modernization efforts, including building and modernizing applications with AI across multi-cloud and hybrid environments, driving efficiency and productivity for developers and IT operations teams alike. 


Red Hat OpenShift’s most significant differentiator is its ability to provide organizations with a consistent infrastructure and application development and delivery experience across various environments, including on-premise data centers, in the public cloud, or at the edge. It also enables [DevOps](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SWOlRH9qStGwSiSCkfwPMpzMfcIIyinSHUsNvbfJM5o/edit#heading=h.66y4kqbj468a) and [Platform Engineering](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OAFQ8hxFCGg1DobkhRrNdqHAxH6RPoOmIc66s97YRk0/edit) teams to concentrate on business-critical activities, minimizing the need to adapt to new tools and processes, enabling greater efficiency.


# 
**Customer challenges**


# 
Organizations must balance their customers’ rising expectations while also growing new business. This includes lowering costs and using all available resources. 


# 
Three key challenges faced by organizations:



* **The ability to develop and deploy flexible, secure, modern applications quickly.** Organizations need to balance their technical debt with tomorrow’s customer demands in a modern application. Organizations usually have a larger number of siloed applications, deployment, and development streams, each with its own management and security practices and requirements. This challenge amplifies inconsistencies in the business.
* **Overwhelming complexity across multi-cloud and hybrid environments: **Application development can become complex, siloed, and inconsistent. Tool sprawl for developers, operations, platform, and security teams hinders consistency in management and the ability to scale. This is amplified when working in a multi-hybrid cloud environment.
* **Low developer productivity: **DevOps teams often spend much of their time maintaining legacy applications, managing infrastructure, or integrating a disparate set of tools, which limits their ability to innovate. Speed in innovation and development while maintaining stability is critical to keep customers happy and organizations competitive in a dynamic market.

## 
**Competitive scenario and differentiators (omit if sharing with partners)**

* **Red Hat OpenShift vs. xKS:** Red Hat OpenShift is distinct from Kubernetes-only solutions like AKS, EKS, and GKE because it provides a comprehensive suite of capabilities for consistent application development, delivery, and management across the hybrid cloud. Additional tools and services need to be sourced and validated by the customer to build a successful modern application platform. Red Hat OpenShift mitigates the burden of a complex and fast-moving ecosystem rather than requiring personnel to keep up with multiple evolving cloud services. Additionally, RHACM and RHACS enable consistency at scale across deployment patterns and environments, by managing and securing OpenShift (and other Kubernetes distributions) clusters at scale.

Customers can manage their own Red Hat OpenShift application platform, deploying it on-premise, in public or private clouds, or at the edge, or use it as a fully managed cloud service by partnering with leading cloud providers like Azure and AWS that offer a first-party fully managed Red Hat OpenShift application platform. Red Hat OpenShift cloud services customers benefit from the expertise of the Red Hat Site Reliability Engineering team (SRE) and the cloud provider, enhancing the management and infrastructure abstraction. In addition, Red Hat OpenShift’s integrated support and cloud tools, consolidated billing, and access to cloud-committed spend programs support customers where they are. 

* **Red Hat OpenShift vs. DIY Kubernetes:** As the number of applications and complexity grows, it is challenging for organizations to manage and maintain their own self-made Kubernetes implementation. Things become more complicated in hybrid environments where the Kubernetes services provided by a cloud provider could differ from what works in the data center. Red Hat OpenShift is a comprehensive application platform that supports the entire application lifecycle at scale, including the components developers and operations teams need to build, test, scale, secure, and deploy applications consistently across any environment—on-premises, in the cloud, or at the edge. Customers can also use Red Hat Services for support, consulting, and training to get the most out of Red Hat OpenShift.
* **Red Hat OpenShift vs. legacy infrastructure: **Legacy infrastructure—for example, those solely using virtual machines—face significant challenges, such as limited scalability, flexibility, and difficulty in integrating with modern technologies. This impacts organizations’ ability to swiftly adapt to evolving customer demands and innovate. Red Hat OpenShift provides a robust solution to these issues. It offers a unified, modern application platform that allows organizations to run and modernize existing applications alongside new, cloud-native applications across the hybrid cloud. This adaptability helps organizations streamline operations, simplify management, enhance developer productivity, and effectively respond to market demands. Red Hat OpenShift extends modern frameworks, tools, and skill sets to legacy applications, such as bringing virtual machines into a cloud-native workflow, improving scalability, reliability, and security, while also reducing costs.

**Appendix**



## **Appendix A: Concepts**

**What are cloud-native applications?**

Cloud-native applications are a collection of small, independent, and loosely coupled services. They are designed to deliver well-recognized business value, like the ability to rapidly incorporate user feedback for continuous improvement. Cloud-native app development is a way to speed up how you build new applications, optimize existing ones, and connect them all. Its goal is to deliver apps users want at the pace a business needs.

**What is an application platform?**

An application platform is an integrated technology stack that natively includes many capabilities and integrations with the technology ecosystem to help developers and platform engineers accelerate the secure and iterative development and delivery of cloud-native applications in a consistent way across the hybrid and multicloud, including edge. The application platform should include capabilities to help simplify modernizing existing applications, developing new applications, and adding intelligence to applications with AI/ML and data analytics. Organizations should be able to consume the application platform as either a public cloud service or self-managed software that can be operationalized on any infrastructure footprint.

**What are containers and Kubernetes?**

A container is a technology that allows organizations to package and isolate applications with all of the files necessary to run, so it becomes easy to move the contained application between environments (dev, test, production, etc.) while retaining full functionality and control. 

Kubernetes is the leading open source container orchestration framework to help automate the deployment and lifecycle management of containers at scale. 

**What is a DevOps process?**

The DevOps process is a collaborative and integrated approach to software development and IT operations aimed at improving the speed, quality, and reliability of delivering applications and services. It emphasizes the following key principles and practices:



* **Continuous integration (CI):** Regularly merging code changes into a central repository, followed by automated builds and tests. This minimizes integration issues and improves software quality.
* **Continuous delivery (CD): **Ensuring that the software can be reliably released at any time. It involves automated testing to validate if changes to the codebase are correct and stable for immediate deployment.
* **Automation:** Automating repetitive tasks such as testing, deployment, and environment setups to increase efficiency and reduce the likelihood of human error.
* **Monitoring and feedback: **Continuously monitoring the performance and health of applications and infrastructure to quickly address issues. Feedback loops are critical for learning and improvement.
* **Collaboration and communication: **Encouraging a culture of open communication and collaboration between development, operations, and other teams. Collaboration and communication bridge gaps between disconnected departments and enhance team synergy.
* **Rapid iteration: **Adopting an iterative approach to software development, enabling teams to adapt and respond to changing needs and feedback quickly.

DevOps integrates tools and practices across the software development lifecycle from planning, coding, and building to testing, releasing, deploying, operating, and monitoring. This holistic approach aims to shorten development cycles, increase deployment frequency, and create more dependable releases, all in close alignment with business objectives.

**What are Operators?**



* Operators are Kubernetes-native software that make applications and infrastructure software easy to package, deploy, and lifecycle manage (e.g. scale in-out, update, upgrade, backup, restores, failure recovery, managing data integrity). 
* Operators don't require the users to be experts on the deployment or management of the containerized application or infrastructure software. They use Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions to provide a simple user experience that automates complex tasks.
* Operators can determine if the application and infrastructure software is running correctly according to configuration best practices defined by the software developer, and make necessary changes to comply with defined or desired configuration. This provides a method to keep current installations in an immutable state. Operators also allow the inclusion of business logic necessary to perform tasks that are required when updating software to a newer version.

**Appendix D: OpenShift style guide and product information**


The Red Hat OpenShift family of products consists of several offerings across on-premise and public cloud footprints and the edge, including self-managed (by the customer) and fully managed (by Red Hat solely, or by Red Hat and its partners jointly). These offerings all share the same fundamental base technologies and offer the same experience across all the deployment options. Our messaging should emphasize the unified experience across the open hybrid cloud, and not be anchored on any particular offering or implementation detail.
