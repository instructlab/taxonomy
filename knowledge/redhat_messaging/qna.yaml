- answer: 'Red Hat OpenShift focuses on security for all components of the application development platform.
 Starting with the foundational layer of Red Hat Enterprise Linux and complemented by the configuration and
best practices from years of experience and thousands of customer deployments to create a cloud native
environment that is trusted and secure.'
  question: 'Why is Red Hat OpenShift trusted more than other Kubernetes solutions?'
- answer: 'Red Hat OpenShift provides a trusted, comprehensive and consistent application platform for
building, deploying, managing and modernizing applications at scale.'
  question: 'What is the value of Red Hat OpenShift?'
- answer: 'Red Hat OpenShift includes additional tools and services out of the box such as CI/CD,
logging, monitoring, service mesh to help accelerate and streamline application development and
deployment and operational efficiency. This reduces the time, resources and expertise needed to
build a DIY application platform. Red Hat OpenShift is also available as  fully-managed cloud
services (specifically Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS, Azure Red Hat OpenShift, and OpenShift
Dedicated on Google Cloud) with an expert site reliability engineering team to add additional
value as a comprehensive app platform.
    '
  question: 'How is Red Hat OpenShift a comprehensive application platform?

    '
- answer: 'Red Hat OpenShift is a hybrid cloud application platform that is trusted,
comprehensive and consistent.
    '
  question: 'What is Red Hat OpenShift?

    '
- answer: 'If you create your own application platform, you are not getting the valuable
benefits of Red Hat OpenShift. OpenShift is trusted, based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux,
from a company with 20+ years of experience in providing secure and trusted software to
industry. OpenShift is a comprehensive product that incorporates over 60 open source
projects pre-integrated, optimized to work together, lifecycled as an enterprise product,
with a broad ecosystem of supported hardware, hyperscalers, infrastructure software and
utilities, and commercial software support. And OpenShift is a consistent experience
across multiple platforms and clouds, self-managed and managed service environments,
allowing developers and platform engineers to be trained on a single product across
use cases, from on-premises to cloud to the edge and beyond.
    '
  question: 'Why should I buy Red Hat OpenShift instead of creating my own platform
built on Kubernetes and open source projects that meets my unique needs?

    '
- answer: 'Customers today leverage their own data centers, public cloud, and edge
environments. Developers do not want to have to learn different skills depending on
the underlying infrastructure, so having a consistent platform regardless of environment
allows for companies to be flexible and scalable regardless of how the choice of
infrastructure changes over time.

    '
  question: 'What is the value of the consistency of Red Hat OpenShift?'
- answer: 'Yes, Red Hat OpenShift can be deployed on premise, in the public cloud,
across multiple clouds, or at the edge. Red Hat OpenShift provides a consistent
experience across the hybrid cloud, regardless of where it is deployed.

  question: 'Can I use red hat openshift in any environment?'
