- answer: 'a. The statement is incorrect because the percentages cannot be added directly.
    The probability of two independent events cannot exceed 100%. Instead, to find
    the probability of both events occurring, you would multiply the individual probabilities:
    0.6 (60%) for Saturday and 0.7 (70%) for Sunday, which equals 0.42, or 42%.'
  question: '73.


    a. Explain what is wrong with the following statement: "If there is a 60% chance
    of rain on Saturday and a 70% chance of rain on Sunday, then there is a 130% chance
    of rain over the weekend."'
- answer: Bias refers to the difference between the expected value of the estimator
    and the true value of the parameter, while variance refers to the spread of the
    distribution of the estimator around its expected value. A biased estimator may
    still be accurate if its variance is small, and an unbiased estimator may be inaccurate
    if its variance is large.
  question: In the context of estimating the expectation of a measurement, what is
    the difference between the bias and the variance of an estimator?
- answer: A binomial distribution is a discrete probability distribution that describes
    the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials. It
    is used to model the number of successes in a fixed number of trials, where each
    trial has only two possible outcomes, such as heads or tails. A Poisson distribution,
    on the other hand, is a discrete probability distribution that describes the number
    of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space. It is used to model
    the number of events occurring in a fixed interval, where the events are rare
    and independent.
  question: What is the difference between a binomial distribution and a Poisson distribution
    in statistics?
