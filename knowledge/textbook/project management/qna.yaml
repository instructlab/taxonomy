- answer: The purpose of monitoring and controlling in project management is to reconcile
    projected performance stated in planning documentation with the team's actual
    performance, and make changes where necessary to get the project back on track.
    It occurs simultaneously with execution and involves collecting progress data
    and sharing it with the people who need to see it in a way that allows them to
    understand and respond to it.
  question: What is the purpose of monitoring and controlling in project management?
- answer: 'Some strategies for breaking an impasse in a negotiation include:


    1. Taking a break and reconvening later.

    2. Changing the negotiation format or location.

    3. Bringing in a mediator or third-party facilitator.

    4. Focusing on interests rather than positions.

    5. Brainstorming creative solutions.

    6. Making small concessions to build trust and momentum.

    7. Exploring trade-offs and package deals.

    8. Re-framing the issue or problem.

    9. Identifying shared values and goals.

  question: What are some strategies for breaking an impasse in a negotiation?
- answer: Behavioral economics, led by researchers like Richard H. Thaler, has challenged
    the traditional economic assumption that humans are entirely predictable in their
    self-interested decision-making. Thaler's work demonstrates that people's choices
    are often influenced by supposedly irrelevant factors, such as emotions or biases,
    which can significantly impact their economic behavior. This realization highlights
    the importance of understanding living order in project management, as human behavior
    can be unpredictable and have far-reaching consequences for project outcomes.
  question: How does the field of behavioral economics challenge the assumption that
    humans are totally predictable in their tendency to make choices that enhance
    their financial well-being?
