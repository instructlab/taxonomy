- answer: The init() function plays a crucial role in making a tree menu more accessible
    by addressing several key aspects of web accessibility. It hides the instructions
    <div> from screen readers by default, replaces unordered list semantics with tree
    menu semantics using role='tree' and aria-labelledby, defines menu items with
    role='treeitem' and removes keyboard access by default with tabindex='-1'. It
    also sets the number of levels in the tree and the number of tree items on a given
    level, and defines the position of each tree item within a level using aria-level,
    aria-setsize, and aria-posinset. Lastly, it sets the aria-expanded state for tree
    items with submenus based on their expanded or collapsed state.
  question: How does the init() function contribute to making a tree menu more accessible
    in terms of keyboard operability and screen reader support?
- answer: The ARIA Alert Support resource in the Toolkit provides information about
    the support for different ARIA alert patterns in different browsers and assistive
    technologies. This resource helps developers to understand the limitations and
    workarounds needed for different alert patterns.
  question: What is the role of the ARIA Alert Support resource in the Toolkit?
- answer: The `aria-hidden='true'` or `aria-hidden='false'` attribute is used to hide
    or show elements for screen readers. When set to `true`, the element and its children
    are hidden from screen readers, and when set to `false`, the element and its children
    are exposed to screen readers. This attribute is useful for managing focus and
    ensuring that users with visual impairments receive relevant information without
    unnecessary clutter.
  question: What is the purpose of using `aria-hidden='true'` or `aria-hidden='false'`
    in web accessibility?
