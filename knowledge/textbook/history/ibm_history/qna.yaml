  - answer: Thomas J. Watson's vision and leadership strategies had a profound
      impact on IBM's growth and corporate culture. He envisioned a unified
      company with a strong culture, focused on the tabulating machine, and
      de-emphasized less promising technologies. Under his leadership, IBM
      doubled its revenue within four years, expanded internationally, and later
      rebranded as International Business Machines in 1924. Watson instilled
      philosophies of globalism, equal pay for equal work, and the imperative to
      always "think," which remain core to IBM's identity.
    question: How did Thomas J. Watson's vision and leadership strategies impact
      IBM's growth and corporate culture?
  - answer: " D) Charles Ranlett Flint was a financier and businessman who
      facilitated the merger of the International Time Recording Company, the
      Computing Scale Company, and the Tabulating Machine Company in 1911, while
      Thomas J. Watson was a salesman who joined the company as general manager
      in 1914 and later became president, focusing resources on the tabulating
      machine and expanding operations internationally."
