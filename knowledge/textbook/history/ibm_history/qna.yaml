      Thomas J. Watson's vision and leadership strategies had a profound
      impact on IBM's growth and corporate culture. He envisioned a unified
      company with a strong culture, focused on the tabulating machine, and
      de-emphasized less promising technologies. Under his leadership, IBM
      doubled its revenue within four years, expanded internationally, and later
      rebranded as International Business Machines in 1924. Watson instilled
      philosophies of globalism, equal pay for equal work, and the imperative to
      always "think," which remain core to IBM's identity.

      in 1914 and later became president, focusing resources on the tabulating
      machine and expanding operations internationally."

      Charles Ranlett Flint and Thomas J. Watson in the formation and early
      success of IBM? A) Charles Ranlett Flint was a financier and businessman
      who founded the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (later IBM) in
      1911, while Thomas J. Watson was a salesman who joined the company as
      general manager in 1914 and later became president, focusing resources on
      the tabulating machine and expanding operations internationally.

  - answer: |
      After its formation, the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company faced
      significant debt and resistance from managers of the merged companies who
      were resentful of the merger and resisted full integration. To overcome
      these challenges, Charles Flint recognized the need for a uniting force
      and a charismatic leader, leading to the hiring of Thomas J. Watson as
      general manager, who later became president and refocused the company
      towards success.

      faced shortly after its formation and how these were overcome.
  - answer: |
     Hollerith’s punched card tabulator, developed in the 1880s, eased the administrative burden of
     hand-counting the population in a country whose numbers were exploding. Its success in the 1890
     census led countries around the world, including Austria, Canada, Cuba, France, Norway, the
     Philippines and Russia, to procure Hollerith’s tabulator for their own national counts.
    question: |
      Who invented, and worked at the US Census Office, the punched card tabulator in the 1880s?
  - answer: |
      That someone was Thomas J. Watson, who believed deeply that the combination of information and technology
      could create a powerful industry unto itself. As IBM’s CEO for 42 years, Watson would shape the company
