- answer: "Humans can distinguish four types of thermal sensations: cold, cool, warm,\
    \ and hot. Low-threshold cold receptors, which are small-diameter A\u03B4 fibers\
    \ with unmyelinated sensory endings, are responsible for the cold sensation. Warm\
    \ receptors, which are unmyelinated small-diameter C fibers, are responsible for\
    \ the warm sensation. Heat nociceptors, which are activated at temperatures greater\
    \ than 45\xB0C and have their output transmitted by both A\u03B4 and C fibers,\
    \ are responsible for the hot and burning pain sensation."
  question: What are the four types of thermal sensations that humans can distinguish,
    and which types of afferent fibers are responsible for each sensation?
- answer: The medial system in the descending control of movement is a part of the
    descending motor systems that includes the cerebral cortical motor areas, brainstem
    nuclei, and spinal circuitry. The medial system is involved in the control of
    posture and locomotion and is organized somatotopically, with the medial group
    innervating axial muscles of the neck and the back and the lateral group innervating
    proximal and distal muscles. Damage to the medial system can result in behavioral
    deficits such as difficulty with posture and locomotion, as well as impaired control
    of axial muscles. The severity of the deficits depends on the location and extent
    of the damage.
  question: What is the medial system in the descending control of movement and what
    are the behavioral deficits that result from damage at this level?
- answer: 'The three pairs of extraocular muscles that control eye movements are:


    1. Medial and lateral rectus: rotate the eye toward the nose or towards the temple,
    respectively.

    2. Superior and inferior rectus: rotate the eye upward or downward, respectively.

    3. Superior oblique and inferior oblique: produce torsional movement toward the
    nose and down, or toward the temple and up, respectively.'
  question: What are the three pairs of extraocular muscles that control eye movements
    and their respective actions?
