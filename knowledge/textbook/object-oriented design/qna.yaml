- answer: The 'idea' stage in the software development lifecycle represents the initial
    concept or vision for a project. While it may be sufficient for small projects,
    larger projects often require a more detailed understanding of the system's requirements.
    The 'idea' stage usually lacks the necessary detail and specificity required for
    successful implementation. Therefore, the requirements formulation phase, with
    methodologies like Use Cases, is essential to clarify and expand upon the initial
    idea, ensuring that the system meets user needs and expectations.
  question: Explain the significance of the 'idea' stage in the software development
    lifecycle and why it is often not sufficient for larger projects.
- answer: The potential drawbacks of using the Singleton pattern in object-oriented
    design include the difficulty of unit testing, the potential for hidden dependencies,
    and the risk of overusing the pattern, leading to a design that is difficult to
    understand and maintain.
  question: What are the potential drawbacks of using the Singleton pattern in object-oriented
    design?
- answer: "In UML class diagrams, the \u226A interface \u226B stereotype is used to\
    \ indicate that a class is an interface. An interface is a template that specifies\
    \ a set of methods without providing an implementation. The \u226A interface \u226B\
    \ stereotype appears in the name box of the interface symbol, which may have only\
    \ two compartments instead of three. Interfaces in UML are used to define a common\
    \ behavior for multiple classes, allowing them to be treated as a single entity."
  question: "What is the purpose of the \u226A interface \u226B stereotype in UML\
    \ class diagrams?"
