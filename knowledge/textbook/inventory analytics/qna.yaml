- answer: The 'priority' attribute denotes the priority level of the event in the
    DES. Events with lower priority numbers are processed first.
  question: What is the significance of the 'priority' attribute in the classes?
- answer: The Powers-of-two Policy Lemma is a concept in inventory management that
    states that the optimal cycle length T in a powers-of-two policy is the smallest
    integer k that satisfies a certain condition. This lemma is used to determine
    the optimal cycle length in settings where order coordination across a range of
    stock keeping units is sought.
  question: What is the Powers-of-two Policy Lemma and how is it used in inventory
    management?
- answer: The 'pmf' parameter in the 'InventoryControl' class instance represents
    the probability mass function of the demand distribution, where each element in
    the list is a list of tuples, with each tuple containing a possible demand value
    and its corresponding probability.
  question: What is the significance of the 'pmf' parameter in the 'InventoryControl'
    class instance?
