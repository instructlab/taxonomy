- answer: '1. Both DS bits are 0: Addr1 identifies the target node, and Addr2 identifies
    the source node. This is the simplest case, where one node is sending directly
    to another.

    2. ToDS = 0 and FromDS = 1: Addr1 identifies the ultimate destination, Addr2 identifies
    the immediate sender (the one that forwarded the frame from the distribution system
    to the ultimate destination), Addr3 identifies the original source, and Addr4
    is not used. This case applies when a wireless node sends a frame to an access
    point (AP) connected to the distribution system.

    3. ToDS = 1 and FromDS = 0: Addr1 identifies the ultimate destination, Addr2 identifies
    the intermediate destination (the one that accepted the frame from a wireless
    node and forwarded it across the distribution system), Addr3 identifies the original
    source, and Addr4 is not used. This case applies when an AP forwards a frame from
    the distribution system to a wireless node.

    4. Both DS bits are 1: Addr1 identifies the ultimate destination, Addr2 identifies
    the immediate sender (the one that forwarded the frame from the distribution system
    to the ultimate destination), Addr3 identifies the intermediate destination (the
    one that accepted the frame from a wireless node and forwarded it across the distribution
    system), and Addr4 identifies the original source. This is the most complex case,
    where the message went from a wireless node onto the distribution system, and
    then from the distribution system to another wireless node.'
  question: What are the four possible interpretations of the four addresses in an
    802.11 frame, depending on the settings of the ToDS and FromDS bits in the frame's
    Control field?
- answer: Bit stuffing in the HDLC protocol is a technique used to ensure that the
    distinguished bit sequence 01111110, which is used to denote the beginning and
    end of a frame, is not mistakenly interpreted as part of the frame's data. When
    the sender is about to transmit five consecutive 1s from the body of the message,
    it inserts a 0 before transmitting the next bit. On the receiving side, if five
    consecutive 1s are received, the receiver makes a decision based on the next bit
    it sees. If the next bit is a 0, it is removed as it was stuffed. If the next
    bit is a 1, the receiver checks the next bit to determine if it is the end-of-frame
    marker or an error has been introduced. This technique ensures that the receiver
    can correctly identify the start and end of each frame, even if the data being
    sent contains the distinguished bit sequence.
  question: What is bit stuffing in the HDLC protocol and how does it work?
- answer: In the context of internetworking, a physical network refers to a single-technology
    network, such as an Ethernet or a wireless network. A logical network, on the
    other hand, is a collection of interconnected physical networks that function
    as a single network, allowing communication between hosts on different networks.
    Routers are devices that interconnect different networks and forward packets between
    them based on their destination IP addresses, creating a logical network by connecting
    multiple physical networks. Switches are devices that forward packets between
    devices on the same network based on their MAC addresses, operating at the data
    link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model.
  question: What is the difference between a physical network and a logical network
    in the context of internetworking, and how do routers and switches relate to these
    concepts?
