        Storage administrators can install and configure an SMB with ceph.
        The Ceph MGR module for SMB provides an interface for deploying and controlling clusters of Samba services and
        managing SMB shares. In the SMB manager module, a cluster is a logical management unit that maps to one or more
        managed Samba services that itself is a cluster and may or may not use any high-availability mechanisms.
        Enabling the SMB services:
        Before communicating with the Ceph MGR module for SMB, it must be enabled first:
        ```bash
        $ ceph mgr module enable smb
        ```
        Usually, SMB is layered on CephFS subvolumes or subvolume groups. Do not create any SMB shares on top of CephFS
        root volumes. You can share a subvolume once or more within a single SMB cluster context. However, defining only
        one SMB share per CephFS subvolume is recommended to keep complexity low.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What is Samba and how does it integrate with Ceph?
        answer: |
          Samba is an open-source implementation of the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol that provides file and
          print services across different operating systems, such as Windows, Mac OS (X), and Linux. The Ceph MGR
          module for SMB integrates Samba with Ceph, providing an interface for deploying and managing clusters of
          Samba services and SMB shares.
      - question: |
          How do you enable the SMB services for Ceph, and what restrictions apply to SMB shares?
        answer: |
          To enable SMB services for Ceph, you run the command: `$ ceph mgr module enable smb`. SMB should only be
          layered on CephFS subvolumes or subvolume groups. It is not recommended to create SMB shares on CephFS
          root volumes, and each CephFS subvolume should have only one SMB share to keep complexity low.
      - question: |
          What are the protocol support limitations for Ceph managed SMB services?
        answer: |
          Ceph managed SMB services only support SMB2 and SMB3. The older SMB1 protocol, also known as CIFS, is not
          supported. Additionally, mixed protocol support for NFS and SMB on the same subvolume is not allowed as it
          may cause data corruption.
  - context: |
        The Ceph MGR module for SMB offers a way to deploy and manage clusters of Samba services and configure SMB
        shares.A cluster in the SMB manager module refers to a logical management unit that can map to one or more
        managed Samba services, possibly with high-availability features.
        Managing SMB clusters involves creating, listing, and removing clusters using imperative commands.
        To create a new cluster, the `ceph smb cluster create` command is used, specifying the cluster ID and
        authentication mode, either as user or active-directory. Listing clusters ensures efficient management
        and uses the `ceph smb cluster ls`command. Clusters can be removed using `ceph smb cluster rm`.
        SMB shares can be created and managed by mapping CephFS volumes and paths to specific clusters. The `ceph smb
        share create` command is used to establish shares, specifying parameters like cluster ID, share ID, and CephFS
        volume. Shares can be removed with the `ceph smb share rm` command, and shares can be listed using
        `ceph smb share ls`.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          How can you create an SMB cluster using Ceph?
        answer: |
          To create an SMB cluster, use `ceph smb cluster create`, specifying the cluster ID and authentication mode.
          For example, specify 'user' or 'active-directory' authentication and provide necessary credentials.
      - question: |
          What are the commands to manage SMB shares in Ceph?
        answer: |
          To create a share, use `ceph smb share create` with details like cluster ID, share ID, and CephFS volume. Use
          `ceph smb share rm` to remove a share and `ceph smb share ls` to list shares.
      - question: |
          What is the purpose of listing SMB clusters in Ceph?
        answer: |
          Listing SMB clusters ensures efficient management and robust data protection. Use `ceph smb cluster ls` to
          view the clusters, with the option to format the output in JSON or YAML.
      - question: |
          What parameters are required to create an SMB cluster in Ceph?
        answer: |
          Parameters include cluster ID (a unique identifier), authentication mode (user or active-directory), and
          options like domain realm, user credentials, custom DNS, placement, and clustering preferences.
      - question: |
          How can you remove an SMB share from a Ceph cluster?
        answer: |
          To remove an SMB share, use the command `ceph smb share rm`, specifying the cluster ID and share ID. This
          removes the specified share from the cluster.
      - question: |
          How do you ensure Ceph's SMB shares are read-only?
        answer: |
          To create a read-only SMB share, use the `--readonly` flag with the `ceph smb share create` command. This
          prevents clients from modifying the shared data.
      - question: |
          Can you mix NFS and SMB file services on the same CephFS subvolume?
        answer: |
          No, mixing NFS and SMB file services on the same CephFS subvolume is not supported. Doing so can potentially
          cause data corruption.
  - context: |
        Integrating Active Directory with SMB using the imperative method requires setting the `auth_mode` parameter to
        active-directory and specifying the cluster ID for the AD setup. The `ceph smb cluster create` command creates a
        new logical cluster identified by the cluster ID and configures it to use Active Directory authentication.
        Parameters like domain realm, AD join user credentials, custom DNS, placement, and clustering options need to be
        specified to complete the setup.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          How do you set up an SMB cluster with Active Directory integration using Ceph?
        answer: |
          Use `ceph smb cluster create` with parameters like cluster ID, `auth_mode: active-directory`, domain realm,
          AD join credentials, custom DNS, placement, and clustering.
      - question: |
          What command is used to create an SMB cluster with Active Directory in Ceph?
        answer: |
          Command `ceph smb cluster create smb1 active-directory --domain_realm DOMAIN_REALM --domain_join_user_pass
          <username>%<password> --custom_dns <DNS_IP> --placement <placement_label> --clustering <clustering_option>`.
      - question: |
          What parameters are necessary for integrating Active Directory with SMB in Ceph?
        answer: |
          Necessary parameters include the cluster ID, `auth_mode: active-directory`, domain realm, domain join user
          credentials, custom DNS, placement details, and clustering options.

        Composing resource spec for the declarative method involves learning how to create SMB clusters and shares
        using resource spec files in either YAML or JSON format.This method is an alternative to the imperative
        approach and is supported by the SMB manager module. You use the `ceph smb apply` command to process these
        specifications, similar to how service specifications are handled with Ceph orchestration using cephadm.
        To create SMB clusters and shares declaratively:
        - Compose a resource specification file in YAML or JSON.
        - Apply the resource file using `ceph smb apply`.
        Example YAML list of resources:
        ```yaml
        - resource_type: ceph.smb.cluster
          cluster_id: rhumba
          # ... other fields skipped for brevity ...
        - resource_type: ceph.smb.cluster
          cluster_id: salsa
          # ... other fields skipped for brevity ...
        - resource_type: ceph.smb.share
          cluster_id: salsa
          share_id: foo
        ```
        YAML format supporting multiple documents:
        ```yaml
        ---
        resource_type: ceph.smb.cluster
        cluster_id: rhumba
        # ... other fields skipped for brevity ...
        ---
        resource_type: ceph.smb.cluster
        cluster_id: salsa
        # ... other fields skipped for brevity ...
        ---
        resource_type: ceph.smb.share
        cluster_id: salsa
        share_id: foo
        ```
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What is the purpose of composing resource specifications for SMB clusters?
        answer: |
          Resource specifications provide a declarative way to configure SMB clusters and shares, as an alternative
          to the imperative method.
      - question: |
          How can you create an SMB cluster using the declarative method?
        answer: |
          Use a resource specification file with `resource_type: ceph.smb.cluster` and apply it using `ceph smb apply`.
      - question: |
          What are the formats supported for resource specifications in the declarative method?
        answer: |
          The formats supported are YAML and JSON.
      - question: |
          How do you view SMB cluster details using the declarative method?
        answer: |
          Use the `ceph smb show` command to display the resources applied to the Ceph cluster configuration.
      - question: |
          How can you remove an SMB share using the declarative method?
        answer: |
          Set `intent: removed` in the resource specification for the SMB share and apply it to remove the share.
  - context: |
        Integrating Active Directory with SMB using the declarative method involves specifying `auth_mode` as
        active-directory in the resource specification file. Here's an example:
        ```yaml
        resource_type: ceph.smb.cluster
        cluster_id: tango
        auth_mode: active-directory
        domain_settings:
          realm: DOMAIN1.SINK.TEST
          join_sources:
            - source_type: resource
              ref: join1-admin
        custom_dns:
          - "192.168.76.204"
        placement:
          count: 1
        ```
        Declarative method configuration example: Setting up an SMB cluster and share involves writing a YAML file
        with the required configurations and applying it.
        Example YAML:
        ```yaml
        resources:
          - resource_type: ceph.smb.cluster
            cluster_id: tango
            auth_mode: active-directory
            domain_settings:
              realm: DOMAIN1.SINK.TEST
              join_sources:
                - source_type: resource
                  ref: join1-admin
            custom_dns:
              - "192.168.76.204"
            placement:
              count: 1
              label: ilovesmb
          - resource_type: ceph.smb.join.auth
            auth_id: join1-admin
            auth:
              username: Administrator
              password: Passw0rd
          - resource_type: ceph.smb.share
            cluster_id: tango
            share_id: cache
            cephfs:
              volume: cephfs
              subvolumegroup: smb1
              subvolume: cache
              path: /
          - resource_type: ceph.smb.share
            cluster_id: tango
            share_id: sp1
            name: "Staff Pics"
            cephfs:
              volume: cephfs
              path: /pics
              subvolumegroup: smb1
              subvolume: staff
        ```
        Save this to `resources.yaml` and run:
        ```bash
        $ ceph smb apply -i resources.yaml
        ```
        To remove resources, use `removed.yaml`:
        ```yaml
        resources:
          - resource_type: ceph.smb.cluster
            cluster_id: tango
            intent: removed
          - resource_type: ceph.smb.join.auth
            auth_id: join1-admin
            intent: removed
          - resource_type: ceph.smb.share
            cluster_id: tango
            share_id: cache
            intent: removed
          - resource_type: ceph.smb.share
            cluster_id: tango
            share_id: sp1
            intent: removed
        ```
        Remove resources with:
        ```bash
        $ ceph smb apply -i removed.yaml
        ```
        SMB File System share access and control: Clients can access shares using SMB support in Windows, MacOS X,
        or Linux. Use the format `\\<hostname>\<sharename>`, ensuring IP addresses are added in the DNS. If the
        cluster and client are in the same AD Domain, single sign-on occurs; otherwise, enter a username and password.
