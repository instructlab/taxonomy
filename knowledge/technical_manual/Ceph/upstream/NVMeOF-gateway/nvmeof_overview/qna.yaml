seed_examples:
- context: |
      The Ceph NVMe-oF Gateway exports RADOS Block Device (RBD) images as NVMe namespaces, enabling clients without
      native Ceph support to access Ceph block storage. It uses the NVMe-oF protocol to send NVMe commands over a
      TCP/IP network, integrating Ceph into conventional storage infrastructures.
  questions_and_answers:
      - question: What does the Ceph NVMe-oF Gateway export?
        answer: |
          It exports RADOS Block Device (RBD) images as NVMe namespaces.
      - question: How does the NVMe-oF protocol benefit clients?
        answer: |
          It allows clients without native Ceph support to send NVMe commands over a TCP/IP network.
      - question: What type of infrastructure can the Ceph NVMe-oF Gateway provision?
        answer: |
          A fully integrated block-storage infrastructure, similar to a conventional SAN.
- context: |
      Each Ceph NVMe-oF gateway consists of an SPDK NVMe-oF target with `bdev_rbd` and a control daemon. This combination
      enables efficient communication between RBD images and NVMe-oF clients for storage access.
  questions_and_answers:
      - question: What are the components of the Ceph NVMe-oF gateway?
        answer: |
          It includes an SPDK NVMe-oF target with `bdev_rbd` and a control daemon.
      - question: What does the `bdev_rbd` module do in the Ceph NVMe-oF gateway?
        answer: |
          It allows RBD images to be used as NVMe namespaces for storage access.
      - question: How does the NVMe-oF gateway facilitate storage access for clients?
        answer: |
          By enabling NVMe-oF protocol communication with RBD images.
- context: |
      The NVMe-oF protocol allows clients to access storage over TCP/IP networks, making Ceph block storage accessible
      to various operating systems without requiring native Ceph client support. This expands Ceph's usability across
      diverse platforms.
  questions_and_answers:
      - question: What network protocol does the NVMe-oF gateway use for communication?
        answer: |
          It uses the NVMe-oF protocol over TCP/IP networks.
      - question: How does the NVMe-oF gateway benefit operating systems without native Ceph support?
        answer: |
          It enables them to access Ceph block storage via the NVMe-oF protocol.
      - question: What key advantage does NVMe-oF bring to Ceph storage?
        answer: |
          It makes Ceph block storage accessible to a wider range of platforms and operating systems.
- context: |
      The Ceph NVMe-oF gateway integrates with the public network and optionally the cluster network. It ensures seamless
      connectivity between NVMe-oF initiators and the Ceph storage cluster, providing reliable block storage operations.
  questions_and_answers:
      - question: Which networks does the Ceph NVMe-oF gateway integrate with?
        answer: |
          It integrates with the public network and optionally the cluster network.
      - question: What role does the public network play in the NVMe-oF gateway setup?
        answer: |
          It facilitates communication between NVMe-oF initiators and the Ceph cluster.
      - question: Why is optional integration with the cluster network useful?
        answer: |
          It provides an additional layer of connectivity for enhanced performance and reliability.
- context: |
