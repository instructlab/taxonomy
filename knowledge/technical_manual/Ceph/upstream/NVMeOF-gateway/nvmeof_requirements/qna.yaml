    - context: |
            To implement a highly-available Ceph NVMe/TCP solution, provision at least two NVMe/TCP gateways on different
            nodes. This ensures fault tolerance and seamless operation by eliminating single points of failure. Proper
            node distribution and redundancy planning are critical for reliability and high availability.
