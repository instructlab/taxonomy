  - question:
      What is the main goal of the InstructLab project?
    answer:
      The main goal of the InstructLab project is to leverage innovative
      techniques for overcoming challenges in LLM training, using
      taxonomy-based curation and synthetic data generation to enable
      contributions to existing LLMs.
  - question:
      How can users contribute to the InstructLab project?
    answer:
      Users can contribute to the InstructLab project by submitting new
      features, resolving bugs and issues, and refining documentation through
      pull requests. They can also contribute their own information and skills to
      the project's taxonomy repository on GitHub.
  - question:
      What is the purpose of the ilab CLI tool?
    answer:
      The ilab CLI tool allows users to interact with LLMs, such as IBM
      AI models Merlinite or Granite. It facilitates augmenting the capabilities
      of these models by enabling users to contribute and train them locally.
  - question:
      How can users see the impact of their contributions on an AI model?
    answer:
      After contributing files to the main AI model through the taxonomy
      repository and having their pull request merged, users can see the impact
      of their contributions when the Merlinite or Granite models are updated.
      They can observe locally that the model has improved with the skills or
      knowledge they taught it.
  - question:
      What is the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) and why is it
      important for contributors?
    answer:
      The Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) is a lightweight way for
      contributors to certify that they have the right to submit the code they
      are contributing to the project. It ensures that contributions adhere to
      the project's open source license and legal requirements. Contributors must
      sign off on their commits by adding a "Signed-off-by" line to certify their
      adherence to the DCO.
