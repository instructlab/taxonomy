    answer: |
      DORA establishes technical requirements for financial entities and ICT providers across four domains.
      These domains are ICT risk management and governance, incident response and reporting, digital
      operational resilience testing, and third-party risk management.
      While information sharing is encouraged, it is not mandatory.
      The requirements will be enforced proportionately, meaning smaller entities will not be held to the
      same standards as major financial institutions. Although the Regulatory Technical Standards (RTSs)
      and Implementing Technical Standards (ITSs) for each domain are still under development,
      the existing DORA legislation provides some insight into the general requirements.
