  - context: For Streamsets pipelines
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: How can I ingest data from S3 to Snowflake using a pipeline
        answer: >-
          A data ingestion pipeline reads data from an S3 bucket and writes it
          to a Snowflake database
      - question: How can I create a pipeline to transform and load data into Redshift
        answer: >-
          A data transformation pipeline applies filters, aggregates, and
          enriches data before loading it into a Redshift cluster
      - question: How can I process real-time log data and store it in Elasticsearch
        answer: >-
          A real-time pipeline streams log data from Kafka, enriches it with
          metadata, and stores it in Elasticsearch for analysis
  - context: For Streamsets Jobs
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is a StreamSets Job?
        answer: >-
          A StreamSets Job is an execution of a data pipeline with specific
          configurations, including runtime parameters and scheduling.
      - question: What are job templates in StreamSets?
        answer: >-
          Job templates in StreamSets allow users to create reusable
          configurations for similar types of data processing tasks.
      - question: What features do StreamSets Jobs provide
        answer: >-
          StreamSets Jobs support monitoring, retries, and alerting to ensure
          reliable pipeline execution.
  - context: For Streamsets Schedulers
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is StreamSets Scheduler used for
        answer: >-
          StreamSets Scheduler is used to automate the execution of pipelines at
          specified intervals
      - question: How do you configure a schedule in StreamSets Scheduler
        answer: >-
          You can configure a schedule by defining the start time, recurrence
          pattern, and time zone
      - question: >-
          What types of recurrence patterns are supported in StreamSets
          Scheduler?
        answer: >-

    questions_and_answers:
      - question: How are users assigned to groups in StreamSets
        answer: >-
          Administrators can assign users to groups in StreamSets to control
          access and streamline permission management.
      - question: What are StreamSets groups?
        answer: >-
          StreamSets groups are collections of users that share common
          permissions and access levels for pipelines and resources.
      - question: Who is a StreamSets user?
        answer: >-
          A StreamSets user is an individual who can log into the platform to
          create and manage data pipelines.
  - context: For streamsets python sdk
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: >-
          What are the typical components of a pipeline in StreamSets Python
          SDK?
