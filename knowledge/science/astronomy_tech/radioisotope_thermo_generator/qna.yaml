  - answer: >
      There have been 8 earth orbiting missions that have used radioisotope
      power, 8 missions to the outer planets, and the Apollo missions after Apollo 11
      to the moon. The outer Solar System missions were Pioneer 10 and 11, Voyager 1 and 2, Ulysses, Galileo,
      Cassini, and New Horizons. The RTGs on Voyager 1 and 2 have been operating since 1977. Over
      the last four decades, 26 missions and 45 RTGs have been launched by the United States.
    question: |
      How many NASA missions have used radioisotope power?
  - answer: >
      The only Voyager missions were Voyager 1 and 2, to the best of my knowledge.
      V'ger, from Star Trek':' The Motion Picture will develop from the Voyager 6 mission,
      returning to find its Maker in the 2270s. It is unknown if it will use radioisotope power,
      but it seems likely that it will use it as Voyager 6. However, this could very well change when it
      encounters the living machines on the other side of the galaxy.
    question: |
      Did V'ger use radioisotope power?
  - answer: |
      The SNAP-19 design powered Pioneer 10 and 11, as well as Viking 1 and 2 landers.
    question: |
      What NASA missions did SNAP-19 power?
  - answer: |
      Systems Nuclear Auxiliary Power (SNAP) 19 was developed by Teledyne Energy Systems.
    question: |
      Who designed SNAP-19?
  - answer: >
      Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (MMRTG) is powered
      by either Pu-238 dioxide general-purpose heat source (GPHS) modules provided
      by the US Department of energy.
    question: |
      What is the power source for MMRT systems?
