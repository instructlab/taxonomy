- context: |
    The **black-capped chickadee** (***Poecile atricapillus***) is a small,
    nonmigratory, North American [passerine](passerine "wikilink") bird that
    lives in deciduous and mixed forests. It is a member of the
    [Paridae](Paridae "wikilink") [family](family_(biology) "wikilink"),
    also known as tits. It has a distinct black cap on its head, a black bib
    underneath, and white cheeks. It has a white belly, buff sides, and grey
    wings, back, and tail. The bird is well known for its vocalizations,
    including its *fee-bee* call and its *chick-a-dee-dee-dee* call, from
    which it derives its name.

    The black-capped chickadee is widely distributed throughout North
    America, ranging from the northern United States to southern Canada and
    all the way up to Alaska and [Yukon](Yukon "wikilink"). It feeds
    primarily on insects and seeds, and is known for its ability to
    [cache](Hoarding_(animal_behavior) "wikilink") food for use during the
    winter. The [hippocampus](hippocampus "wikilink") of the black-capped
    chickadee grows during the caching season, which is believed to help it
    better remember its cache locations. The black-capped chickadee is a
    social bird and forms strict [dominance
    hierarchies](Dominance_hierarchy "wikilink") within its flock. During
    the winter, these flocks include other bird species. It has the ability
    to lower its body temperature during cold winter nights, allowing it to
    conserve energy.

      known for its ability to cache food for use during the winter.
    question: |
      What does a black-capped chickadee eat?
- context: |
    The black-capped chickadee has a black cap and "bib" with white cheeks.
    Its underparts are white with buff-colored flanks. Its back is
    unstreaked and greenish gray, and the tail and wings are slate gray. It
    has a black [beak](beak "wikilink") and legs, and dark brown
    [irises](iris_(anatomy) "wikilink"). Males and females are generally
    similar, although males have a larger bib. They can also be
    distinguished based on a combination of weight and tail length.
    [Tarsus](Bird_feet_and_legs "wikilink") length does not significantly
    differentiate sexes. Males have a wing length of 63.5–67.5 mm (2.50–2.66 in),
    a tail length of 58–63 mm (2.3–2.5 in), a bill length of 8–9.5 mm (0.31–0.37 in),
    and a tarsus length of 16–17 mm (0.63–0.67 in). Females are on average slightly
    smaller, with a wing length of 60.5–66.5 mm (2.38–2.62 in), a tail length of
    56.3–63 mm (2.22–2.48 in), a bill length of 9–9.5 mm (0.35–0.37 in), and a
    tarsus length of 16–17 mm (0.63–0.67 in). Both sexes weigh 10–14 g (0.35–0.49 oz).
    Juveniles are visually similar to adults but with fluffier plumage.
  questions_and_answers:
  - answer: |
      The black-capped chickadee has a black cap and "bib" with white
      cheeks.
    question: |
      What color cheeks does the black capped chickadee have?
  - answer: |
      Yes, males and females are generally similar, although males have a
      larger bib.
    question: |
      Do male black capped chickadees have a larger bib than the females?
  - answer: |
      Juveniles are visually similar to adults but with fluffier plumage.
    question: |
      How can you tell that a black capped chickadee is a juvenile?
- context: |
    One of the most recognizable sounds produced, particularly by the males,
    is the two-note *fee-bee* song. It is a simple, clear whistle of two
    notes, identical in rhythm, the first roughly a
    [whole-step](Major_second "wikilink") above the second. The
    frequency of their songs will typically start around
    400 [Hz](Hertz "wikilink"), and various tones spanning roughly 1 kHz
    will be sung within the song. A decrease of roughly 200 Hz occurs when
    the first note (*fee*) is sung, and then another decrease around 400 Hz
    takes place between the end of *fee* and the beginning of *bee*. In
    spite of these multiple changes in frequency, though, anybody listening
    to the song only hears a pure, high-frequency tone. This is
    distinguished from the Carolina chickadee's four-note call *fee-bee
    fee-bay*; the lower notes are nearly identical but the higher *fee*
    notes are omitted, making the black-capped song like *bee bay*. The
    males sing the song only in relative isolation from other chickadees
    (including their mates). In late summer, some young birds sing only a
    single note.

      The frequency of their songs will typically start around 400 Hz,
      and various tones spanning roughly 1 kHz will be sung within the
      song. A decrease of roughly 200 Hz occurs when the first note (fee)
      is sung, and then another decrease around 400 Hz takes place between
      the end of fee and the beginning of bee.
    question: |
      What is the frequency of the black-capped chickadee's fee-bee
      song?
  - answer: |
      No, the males sing the song only in relative isolation from other
      chickadees (including their mates).
    question: |
      Do male black-capped chickadees sing their fee-bee song with other
      chickadees around?
- context: |
    Insects (especially caterpillars) form a large part of their diet in
    summer. The birds hop along tree branches searching for food, sometimes
    hanging upside down or hovering; they may make short flights to catch
    insects in the air. Seeds and berries become more important in winter,
    though insect eggs and pupae are eaten when available. Black-capped
    chickadees have also been known to eat the fat off of dead mammals.
    Sunflower seeds are readily taken from bird feeders. The birds take a
    seed in their beak and commonly fly from the feeder to a tree, where
    they proceed to hammer the seed on a branch to open it.

    Like many other species in the family Paridae, black-capped chickadees
    commonly [cache](Hoarding_(animal_behavior) "wikilink") food, mostly
    seeds, but sometimes insects, also. Items are stored singly in
    various sites such as bark, dead leaves, clusters of conifer needles, or
    knothole. Memory for the location of caches can last up to 28 days.
    Within the first 24 hours, the birds can even remember the relative
    quality of the stored items.

    question: |
      How long can black-capped chickadees remember where they cached
      their food?
- context: |
    Black-capped chickadees are primarily subject to predation by [birds of
    prey](birds_of_prey "wikilink"), including owls, hawks, and shrikes.
    Nest-predation also occurs, primarily by raccoons, squirrels, opossums,
    and snakes. Nest sites are also sometimes raided by [house
    wrens](house_wren "wikilink"), who will destroy chickadee eggs in order
    to reuse the location for their nest.

    Like many birds, black-capped chickadees are susceptible to [West Nile
    Virus](West_Nile_Virus "wikilink"). They are also known to be affected
    by blood parasites, including those that cause
    [malaria](malaria "wikilink"), but particularly high rates of infection
    have not been detected. Black-capped chickadees are also known to
    be affected by [avian keratin
    disorder](avian_keratin_disorder "wikilink").
