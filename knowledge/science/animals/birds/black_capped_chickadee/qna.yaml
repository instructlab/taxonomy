      The **black-capped chickadee** (***Poecile atricapillus***) is a small,
      nonmigratory, North American [passerine](passerine "wikilink") bird that
      lives in deciduous and mixed forests. It is a member of the
      [Paridae](Paridae "wikilink") [family](family_(biology) "wikilink"),
      also known as tits. It has a distinct black cap on its head, a black bib
      underneath, and white cheeks. It has a white belly, buff sides, and grey
      wings, back, and tail. The bird is well known for its vocalizations,
      including its *fee-bee* call and its *chick-a-dee-dee-dee* call, from
      which it derives its name.

      The black-capped chickadee is widely distributed throughout North
      America, ranging from the northern United States to southern Canada and
      all the way up to Alaska and [Yukon](Yukon "wikilink"). It feeds
      primarily on insects and seeds, and is known for its ability to
      [cache](Hoarding_(animal_behavior) "wikilink") food for use during the
      winter. The [hippocampus](hippocampus "wikilink") of the black-capped
      chickadee grows during the caching season, which is believed to help it
      better remember its cache locations. The black-capped chickadee is a
      social bird and forms strict [dominance
      hierarchies](Dominance_hierarchy "wikilink") within its flock. During
      the winter, these flocks include other bird species. It has the ability
      to lower its body temperature during cold winter nights, allowing it to
      conserve energy.

      - question: |
          What sound does a black-capped chickadee make?
        answer: |
          The black-capped chickadee is well known for its vocalizations,
          including its fee-bee call and its chick-a-dee-dee-dee call, from
          which it derives its name.
      - question: |
          What does a black-capped chickadee eat?
        answer: |
          Black-capped chickadees feed primarily on insects and seeds, and is
          known for its ability to cache food for use during the winter.
  - context: |
      The black-capped chickadee has a black cap and "bib" with white cheeks.
      Its underparts are white with buff-colored flanks. Its back is
      unstreaked and greenish gray, and the tail and wings are slate gray. It
      has a black [beak](beak "wikilink") and legs, and dark brown
      [irises](iris_(anatomy) "wikilink"). Males and females are generally
      similar, although males have a larger bib. They can also be
      distinguished based on a combination of weight and tail length.
      [Tarsus](Bird_feet_and_legs "wikilink") length does not significantly
      differentiate sexes. Males have a wing length of 63.5–67.5 mm (2.50–2.66 in),
      a tail length of 58–63 mm (2.3–2.5 in), a bill length of 8–9.5 mm (0.31–0.37 in),
      and a tarsus length of 16–17 mm (0.63–0.67 in). Females are on average slightly
      smaller, with a wing length of 60.5–66.5 mm (2.38–2.62 in), a tail length of
      56.3–63 mm (2.22–2.48 in), a bill length of 9–9.5 mm (0.35–0.37 in), and a
      tarsus length of 16–17 mm (0.63–0.67 in). Both sexes weigh 10–14 g (0.35–0.49 oz).
      Juveniles are visually similar to adults but with fluffier plumage.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What color cheeks does the black capped chickadee have?
        answer: |
          The black-capped chickadee has a black cap and "bib" with white
          cheeks.
      - question: |
          Do male black capped chickadees have a larger bib than the females?
        answer: |
          Yes, males and females are generally similar, although males have a
          larger bib.
      - question: |
          How can you tell that a black capped chickadee is a juvenile?
        answer: |
          Juveniles are visually similar to adults but with fluffier plumage.
  - context: |
      One of the most recognizable sounds produced, particularly by the males,
      is the two-note *fee-bee* song. It is a simple, clear whistle of two
      notes, identical in rhythm, the first roughly a
      [whole-step](Major_second "wikilink") above the second. The
      frequency of their songs will typically start around
      400 [Hz](Hertz "wikilink"), and various tones spanning roughly 1 kHz
      will be sung within the song. A decrease of roughly 200 Hz occurs when
      the first note (*fee*) is sung, and then another decrease around 400 Hz
      takes place between the end of *fee* and the beginning of *bee*. In
      spite of these multiple changes in frequency, though, anybody listening
      to the song only hears a pure, high-frequency tone. This is
      distinguished from the Carolina chickadee's four-note call *fee-bee
      fee-bay*; the lower notes are nearly identical but the higher *fee*
      notes are omitted, making the black-capped song like *bee bay*. The
      males sing the song only in relative isolation from other chickadees
      (including their mates). In late summer, some young birds sing only a
      single note.

      - question: |
          What is the black-capped chickadee's fee-bee song?
        answer: |
          It is a simple, clear whistle of two notes, identical in rhythm,
          the first roughly a whole-step above the second.
      - question: |
          What is the frequency of the black-capped chickadee's fee-bee
          song?
        answer: |
          The frequency of their songs will typically start around 400 Hz,
          and various tones spanning roughly 1 kHz will be sung within the
          song. A decrease of roughly 200 Hz occurs when the first note (fee)
          is sung, and then another decrease around 400 Hz takes place between
          the end of fee and the beginning of bee.
      - question: |
          Do male black-capped chickadees sing their fee-bee song with other
          chickadees around?
        answer: |
          No, the males sing the song only in relative isolation from other
          chickadees (including their mates).
  - context: |
      Insects (especially caterpillars) form a large part of their diet in
      summer. The birds hop along tree branches searching for food, sometimes
      hanging upside down or hovering; they may make short flights to catch
      insects in the air. Seeds and berries become more important in winter,
      though insect eggs and pupae are eaten when available. Black-capped
      chickadees have also been known to eat the fat off of dead mammals.
      Sunflower seeds are readily taken from bird feeders. The birds take a
      seed in their beak and commonly fly from the feeder to a tree, where
      they proceed to hammer the seed on a branch to open it.

      Like many other species in the family Paridae, black-capped chickadees
      commonly [cache](Hoarding_(animal_behavior) "wikilink") food, mostly
      seeds, but sometimes insects, also. Items are stored singly in
      various sites such as bark, dead leaves, clusters of conifer needles, or
      knothole. Memory for the location of caches can last up to 28 days.
      Within the first 24 hours, the birds can even remember the relative
      quality of the stored items.

      - question: |
          How long can black-capped chickadees remember where they cached
          their food?
        answer: |
          Memory for the location of caches can last up to 28 days.
  - context: |
      Black-capped chickadees are primarily subject to predation by [birds of
      prey](birds_of_prey "wikilink"), including owls, hawks, and shrikes.
      Nest-predation also occurs, primarily by raccoons, squirrels, opossums,
      and snakes. Nest sites are also sometimes raided by [house
      wrens](house_wren "wikilink"), who will destroy chickadee eggs in order
      to reuse the location for their nest.

      Like many birds, black-capped chickadees are susceptible to [West Nile
      Virus](West_Nile_Virus "wikilink"). They are also known to be affected
      by blood parasites, including those that cause
      [malaria](malaria "wikilink"), but particularly high rates of infection
      have not been detected. Black-capped chickadees are also known to
      be affected by [avian keratin
      disorder](avian_keratin_disorder "wikilink").

      - question: |
          What birds of prey eat black-capped chickadees?
        answer: |
          Black-capped chickadees are primarily subject to predation by birds
          of prey, including owls, hawks, and shrikes.
      - question: |
          What is a big danger to black-capped chickadee nests?
        answer: |
          Nest sites are also sometimes raided by house wrens, who will
          destroy chickadee eggs in order to reuse the location for their nest.
      - question: |
          Do black-capped chickadees carry the West Nile virus?
        answer: |
          Like many birds, black-capped chickadees are susceptible to West
          Nile Virus.
