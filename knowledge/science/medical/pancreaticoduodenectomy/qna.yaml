  - answer: A pancreaticoduodenectomy is a major surgical operation most often performed to remove cancerous 
      tumours from the head of the pancreas. It is also used for the treatment 
      of pancreatic or duodenal trauma, or chronic pancreatitis. Due to the shared 
      blood supply of organs in the proximal gastrointestinal system, surgical 
      removal of the head of the pancreas also necessitates removal of the duodenum, 
      proximal jejunum, gallbladder, and, occasionally, part of the stomach.
    question: what is pancreaticoduodenectomy.
  - answer: "The most common technique of a pancreaticoduodenectomy consists of 
      the en bloc removal of the distal segment (antrum) of the stomach, the first and 
      second portions of the duodenum, the head of the pancreas, the common bile duct, 
      and the gallbladder. Lymph nodes in the area are often removed during the operation 
      as well (lymphadenectomy). However, not all lymph nodes are removed in the most common 
      type of pancreaticoduodenectomy because studies showed that patients did not benefit 
      from the more extensive surgery."
    question: >
      which parts of the stomach stomach are removed in pancreaticoduodenectomy procedure.
  - answer: Pancreaticoduodenectomy is the only potentially curative intervention for malignant 
      tumors of the pancreas. However, the majority of patients with pancreatic cancer present 
      with metastatic or locally advanced un-resectable disease; thus only 15â€“20% of patients 
      are candidates for the Whipple procedure. Surgery may follow neoadjuvant chemotherapy, which 
      aims to shrink the tumor and increase the likelihood of complete resection. Post-operative 
      death and complications associated with pancreaticoduodenectomy have become less common, with 
      rates of post-operative mortality falling from 30 to 10% in the 1980s to less than 5% in the 2000s.
    question: Describe the pancreatic cancer
    answer: >
      Three of the most common post-operative complications are delayed gastric emptying, bile leak, and 
      pancreatic leak. Delayed gastric emptying, normally defined as an inability to tolerate a regular diet 
      by the end of the first post-op week and the requirement for nasogastric tube placement, occurs in 
      approximately 17% of operations. During the surgery, a new biliary connection (normally a 
      choledochal-jejunal anastamosis connecting the common bile duct and jejunum) is made. This new connection 
      may leak in 1-2% of operations. As this complication is fairly common, it is normal in this procedure for 
      the surgeon to leave a drain in place at the end. This allows for detection of a bile leak via elevated 
      bilirubin in the fluid drained. Pancreatic leak or pancreatic fistula, defined as fluid drained after 
      postoperative day 3 that has an amylase content greater than or equal to 3 times the upper limit of normal, 
      occurs in 5-10% of operations, although changes in the definition of fistula may now include a much 
      larger proportion of patients (upwards of 40%).
    question: Please list postoperative complications of pancreaticoduodenectomy.
