  - question: What is a pancreaticoduodenectomy?
    answer: >
      Pancreaticoduodenectomy is a major surgical operation most often performed
      to remove cancerous tumours

      from the head of the pancreas
  - question: What is a Whipple procedure?
    answer: This is another name for pancreaticoduodenectomy
  - question: Can a head pancreas tumor be gently removed?
    answer: >
      Due to the shared blood supply of organs in the proximal gastrointestinal
      system, surgical removal of the head of the pancreas also necessitates
      removal of the duodenum, proximal jejunum, gallbladder, and, occasionally,
      part of the stomach
  - question: What are the main indications for a Whipple procedure?
    answer: >
      Pancreaticoduodenectomy is most often performed as curative treatment for
      periampullary cancer, which include cancer of the bile duct, duodenum,
      ampulla or head of the pancreas. The shared blood supply of the pancreas,
      duodenum and common bile duct necessitates en bloc resection of these
      multiple structures. Other indications for pancreaticoduodenectomy include
      chronic pancreatitis, benign tumors of the pancreas, cancer metastatic to
      the pancreas, multiple endocrine neoplasia type and gastrointestinal
      stromal tumors
  - question: What are other indications for a Whipple procedure?
    answer: >
      Pancreaticoduodenectomy is also used for the treatment of pancreatic or
      duodenal trauma, or chronic pancreatitis
  - question: What are the contradictions of a pancreaticoduodenectomy?
    answer: >
      Absolute contraindications for the procedure are metastatic disease in the
      abdominal cavity or nearby organs. These are found most often on the
      peritoneum, in the liver, and in the omentum. In order to determine if
      there are metastases, surgeons will inspect the abdomen at the beginning
      of the procedure after gaining access. Alternatively, they may perform
      a separate procedure called a diagnostic laparoscopy which involves
      insertion of a small camera through a small incision to look inside
      the abdomen. This may spare the patient the large abdominal incision that
      would occur if they were to undergo the initial part of a
      pancreaticoduodenectomy that was cancelled due to metastatic disease.
      Further contraindications include encasement of major vessels (such as
      celiac artery, inferior vena cava, or superior mesenteric artery) as
      mentioned above.
