  question: Give me 3 species of poison ivy
- answer: | Poison ivies can grow as small plants, shrubs, or climbing vines.[4] They are commonly characterized by clusters of leaves, each containing three leaflets,[4] hence the common expression "leaves of three, let it be".
  question: Describe the characteristics of Poison Ivy
- answer: | The oozing fluids released by scratching blisters do not spread the poison. The fluid in the blisters is produced by the body and it is not urushiol itself.
  question: Are the blisters contagious 
- answer: | Immediate washing with soap and cold water or rubbing alcohol may help prevent a reaction.
  question: How can I best prevent a reaction from Poison Ivy if exposed.
- answer: | Typically, the rash from the urushiol oil lasts about five to twelve days, but in extreme cases it can last a month or more. A urushiol rash usually develops within a week of exposure and can last 1â€“4 weeks, depending on severity and treatment. In rare cases, urushiol reactions may require hospitalization.
  question: How long can a reaction with Poison Ivy last?
