  Swiss German refers to the Alemannic German dialects spoken in German-speaking
  Switzerland and some areas of Italy, Liechtenstein, and Austria. Used in daily
  life, it's distinct from Swiss Standard German, which is taught in schools.
  While mutually intelligible with other Alemannic dialects, Swiss German is
  largely unintelligible to Standard German speakers.
