      "To compare weights in pounds  and kilograms, you can convert one

      to the other scale. The formula to convert pounds to kilograms is 1lbs = 0,453592 kg


      Lets convert 30lbs to kg


      30 * 0,453592 = 13,60 kg



      Therefore, 30 lbs  are 13,60 kg which is lighter than 20kg.

      So we can conclude that 20kg are heavier than 30lbs"
  - question: Convert 72 kilograms into lbs?
