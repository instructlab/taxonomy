      To solve the system of equations:
      1) ( x + y = 10 )
      2) ( 2x - y = 3 )
      Step 1: Solve equation (1) for ( y ):
      ( y = 10 - x )
      Step 2: Substitute ( y ) in equation (2):
      ( 2x - (10 - x) = 3 )
      Simplify:
      ( 2x - 10 + x = 3 )
      ( 3x - 10 = 3 )
      ( 3x = 13 )
      ( x = 13/3 )
      Step 3: Substitute ( x ) back into equation (1):
      ( x + y = 10 )
      ( 13/3 + y = 10 )
      ( y = 10 - 13/3 )
      ( y = 30/3 - 13/3 )
      ( y = 17/3 )
      The solution is ( x = 13/3 ) and ( y = 17/3 ).

      To solve the system of equations:
      1) ( 3x - 2y = 4 )
      2) ( x + y = 5 )
      Step 1: Solve equation (2) for ( y ):
      ( y = 5 - x )
      Step 2: Substitute ( y ) in equation (1):
      ( 3x - 2(5 - x) = 4 )
      Simplify:
      ( 3x - 10 + 2x = 4 )
      ( 5x - 10 = 4 )
      ( 5x = 14 )
      ( x = 14/5 )
      Step 3: Substitute ( x ) back into equation (2):
      ( x + y = 5 )
      ( 14/5 + y = 5 )
      ( y = 5 - 14/5 )
      ( y = 25/5 - 14/5 )
      ( y = 11/5 )
      The solution is ( x = 14/5 ) and ( y = 11/5 ).

      To solve the system of equations:
      1) ( x - y = 2 )
      2) ( 4x + 3y = 7 )
      Step 1: Solve equation (1) for ( x ):
      ( x = y + 2 )
      Step 2: Substitute ( x ) in equation (2):
      ( 4(y + 2) + 3y = 7 )
      Simplify:
      ( 4y + 8 + 3y = 7 )
      ( 7y + 8 = 7 )
      ( 7y = -1 )
      ( y = -1/7 )
      Step 3: Substitute ( y ) back into equation (1):
      ( x - y = 2 )
      ( x - (-1/7) = 2 )
      ( x + 1/7 = 2 )
      ( x = 2 - 1/7 )
      ( x = 14/7 - 1/7 )
      ( x = 13/7 )
      The solution is ( x = 13/7 ) and ( y = -1/7 ).

      To solve the system of equations:
      1) ( 5x + 2y = 20 )
      2) ( x - 3y = -6 )
      Step 1: Solve equation (2) for ( x ):
      ( x = 3y - 6 )
      Step 2: Substitute ( x ) in equation (1):
      ( 5(3y - 6) + 2y = 20 )
      Simplify:
      ( 15y - 30 + 2y = 20 )
      ( 17y - 30 = 20 )
      ( 17y = 50 )
      ( y = 50/17 )
      Step 3: Substitute ( y ) back into equation (2):
      ( x - 3y = -6 )
      ( x - 3(50/17) = -6 )
      ( x - 150/17 = -6 )
      ( x = -6 + 150/17 )
      ( x = -102/17 + 150/17 )
      ( x = 48/17 )

      2) ( 3x - 2y = 4 )
      Step 1: Solve (1) for ( y ): ( y = 7 - 2x )
      Step 2: Substitute ( y ) in (2): ( 3x - 2(7 - 2x) = 4 )
