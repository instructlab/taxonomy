      Solve the system of equations:
      1) ( x + y = 10 )
      2) ( 2x - y = 3 )
      Step 1: Solve (1) for ( y ): ( y = 10 - x )
      Step 2: Substitute ( y ) in (2): ( 2x - (10 - x) = 3 )
      Simplify: ( 3x - 10 = 3 ) -> ( 3x = 13 ) -> ( x = frac{13}{3} )
      Step 3: Substitute ( x ) in (1): ( frac{13}{3} + y = 10 )
      Simplify: ( y = frac{17}{3} )
      Solution: ( x = frac{13}{3}, y = frac{17}{3} )

      2) ( 3x - 2y = 4 )
      Step 1: Solve (1) for ( y ): ( y = 7 - 2x )
      Step 2: Substitute ( y ) in (2): ( 3x - 2(7 - 2x) = 4 )
