      Under GDPR, a person has the right to ask a company to delete their personal information if
      certain conditions apply. These conditions include situations where the information is no
      longer needed for the purpose it was collected, the person has withdrawn their consent for the
      company to use their data (if that consent was the basis for the data processing), or the
      person objects to the company using their data and there’s no significant legal reason for the
      company to keep it. The company must comply and delete the data quickly if these conditions
      are met.
    question: |
      Simplify the complex legal language of the following legal article into plain English for
      easy understanding; Article 17 of the GDPR states; The data subject shall have the right to
      obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data concerning him or her without undue
      delay and the controller shall have the obligation to erase personal data without undue delay
      where one of the following grounds applies; the personal data are no longer necessary in
      relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed; the data subject
      withdraws consent on which the processing is based according to point (a) of Article 6(1), or
      point (a) of Article 9(2), and where there is no other legal ground for the processing; the
      data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(1) and there are no overriding
      legitimate grounds for the processing, or the data subject objects to the processing pursuant
      to Article 21(2).
  - answer: |
      Under GDPR, a company can only use personal information legally if one of these conditions
      applies; the person has agreed to let the company use their data for specific reasons; the use
      of data is essential to fulfill a contract with the person; the company needs to use the data
      to meet a legal requirement; the data use is necessary to protect someone's crucial interests;
      the data is used for a task that benefits the public or is part of an official duty; or the
      data use is for the company’s legitimate business interests, but not if this would unfairly
      go against the person’s rights, especially if the person is a child. This ensures that personal
      data is processed fairly and with a valid reason.
    question: |
      Simplify the complex legal language of the following legal article into plain English for
      easy understanding; Article 6(1) of the GDPR states; Processing shall be lawful only if and
      to the extent that at least one of the following applies; the data subject has given consent
      to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes; the processing
      is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order
      to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract; the
      processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is
      subject; the processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data
      subject or of another natural person; the processing is necessary for the performance of a
      task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the
      controller; the processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by
      the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests
      or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal
      data, particularly when the data subject is a child.
  - answer: |
      Under GDPR, a person has the right to not be subject to important decisions made solely by
      automated systems or software, such as algorithms or profiling tools, if these decisions have
      a significant impact on their life. This includes decisions like being approved for a loan,
      receiving healthcare services, or job eligibility without any human oversight. This rule helps
      protect individuals from potentially harmful decisions that are made without human judgment and
      understanding of context.
    question: |
      Simplify the complex legal language of the following legal article into plain English for
      easy understanding; Article 22(1) of the GDPR states; The data subject shall have the right not
      to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which
      produces legal effects concerning him or her or similarly significantly affects him or her.
  - answer: |
      Data Security and Integrity; Personal information must be handled securely to prevent
      unauthorized or illegal access, loss, destruction, or damage. This involves using proper safety
      measures and organizational practices to protect the data.
    question: |
      Simplify the complex legal language of the following legal article into plain English for
      easy understanding; Article 5(1)(f) of the GDPR ; Personal data shall be processed in a manner
      that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against
      unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using
      appropriate technical or organizational measures (integrity and confidentiality).
  - answer: |
      Right of Access; Individuals have the right to know if their personal data is being processed,
      and if so, they can access their data. They are entitled to know why their data is being
      processed, who has access to it, how long it will be kept, and their rights regarding the
      modification, deletion, or restriction of their data. They can also find out about the source
      of data not collected directly from them, and understand any automated decision-making that
      affects them, including how these decisions are made.
    question: |
      Simplify the complex legal language of the following legal article into plain English for
      easy understanding; Article 15 of the GDPR; The data subject shall have the right to obtain
      from the controller confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning him or her are
      being processed, and, where that is the case, access to the personal data and the following
      information; the purposes of the processing; the categories of personal data concerned; the
      recipients or categories of recipients to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed,
      particularly recipients in third countries or international organisations; the envisaged period
      for which the personal data will be stored, or, if not possible, the criteria used to determine
      that period; the existence of the right to request from the controller rectification or erasure
      of personal data or restriction of processing of personal data concerning the data subject or
      to object to such processing; the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority;
      where the personal data are not collected from the data subject, any available information as
      to their source; the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, referred to
      in Article 22(1) and (4) and, at least in those cases, meaningful information about the logic
      involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing for
      the data subject.
  - answer: |
      Right to Data Portability; Individuals have the right to obtain and reuse their personal data
      across different services. They can request their data from one service provider in a common
      format and transfer it to another provider easily, provided the data was originally given with
      consent or under a contract, and the processing is done using automated systems. This enhances
      control over their own data by facilitating its movement between service providers.
    question: |
      Simplify the complex legal language of the following legal article into plain English for
      easy understanding; Article 20 of the GDPR; The data subject shall have the right to receive
      the personal data concerning him or her, which he or she has provided to a controller, in a
      structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, and have the right to transmit those
      data to another controller without hindrance from the controller to which the personal data
      have been provided, insofar as the processing is based on consent pursuant to point (a) of
      Article 6(1) or point (a) of Article 9(2), or on a contract pursuant to point (b) of Article
      6(1), and the processing is carried out by automated means.
  - answer: |
      Data Security Requirements; GDPR mandates that organizations must adopt appropriate security
      measures to protect personal data, considering current technology and the cost of
      implementation. This includes encrypting personal data, ensuring systems are secure and
      resilient, being able to restore data promptly after incidents, and regularly testing and
      assessing the effectiveness of these security measures. These steps are crucial to safeguard
      individuals data from unauthorized access or breaches.
    question: |
      Simplify the complex legal language of the following legal article into plain English for
      easy understanding; Article 32 of the GDPR; Taking into account the state of the art, the costs
      of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk
      of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the
      controller and the processor shall implement appropriate technical and organizational measures
      to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including inter alia as appropriate;
      the pseudonymisation and encryption of personal data; the ability to ensure the ongoing
      confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services;
      the ability to restore the availability and access to personal data in a timely manner in the
      event of a physical or technical incident; a process for regularly testing, assessing and
      evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures for ensuring the security
      of the processing.
  - answer: |
      Data Protection Impact Assessment; GDPR requires organizations to conduct a thorough risk
      assessment known as a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) before starting any type of
      data processing that might pose a high risk to individuals rights and freedoms. This is
      particularly necessary when introducing new technologies. The DPIA should evaluate the impact
      of the proposed data processing activities on the privacy and protection of personal data. If
      several related processing activities carry similar risks, they can be assessed together under
      a single DPIA. This assessment helps ensure that organizations understand and mitigate any
      risks that data processing might pose to individual privacy and data security before they
      proceed.
    question: |
      Simplify the complex legal language of the following legal article into plain English for
      easy understanding; Article 35 of the GDPR; Where a type of processing in particular using new
      technologies, and taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of the
      processing, is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons,
      the controller shall, prior to the processing, carry out an assessment of the impact of the
      envisaged processing operations on the protection of personal data. A single assessment may
      address a set of similar processing operations that present similar high risks.
  - answer: |
      Right to Object to Processing; Under GDPR, individuals have the right to object to the
      processing of their personal data at any time, especially if the processing is based on the
      performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official
      authority (point (e)), or for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by the organization
      or a third party (point (f)). This also applies to profiling based on these grounds. The
      organization must stop processing personal data unless it can demonstrate strong legitimate
      reasons for the processing that outweigh the individuals interests, rights, and freedoms, or if
      the processing is necessary for legal claims. This right ensures that individuals have a say in
      the use of their data, particularly in contexts where personal preferences and freedoms might
      be significantly impacted.
    question: |
      Simplify the complex legal language of the following legal article into plain English for
      easy understanding; Article 21 of the GDPR; The data subject shall have the right to object at
      any time to processing of personal data concerning him or her which is based on point (e) or
      (f) of Article 6(1), including profiling based on those provisions. The controller shall no
      longer process the personal data unless the controller demonstrates compelling legitimate
      grounds for the processing which override the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject
      or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
