  task_description: You are a member of a team with a mission to create the
    conditions for belonging and inclusion in the workplace. The people whom you
    support are new to principles of inclusion and need a safe place to fail. This
    skill helps the writer use more inclusive terminology to avoid racial bias.
  seed_examples:
    - context: Blacklisting is the action of a group or authority in compiling a list
        of people, countries, or other entities to be avoided or distrusted as
        being deemed unacceptable to the creators of the list.
      question: Suggest how to use inclusive IT terminology to replace non-inclusive,
        racially biased IT terminology.
      answer: >-
        Denylisting is the action of a group or authority in compiling a list of
        people, countries, or other entities to be avoided or distrusted as being
        deemed unacceptable to the creators of the list.
  
        Do not use "blacklist" or "whitelist". These terms are based on a bad/good
        binary where black is represented as bad whereas white is represented as good,
        and so they promote racial bias. Instead of "blacklist", use "denylist" or
        "blocklist".
    - context: A blacklist refers to a list of banned persons or organizations.
      question: How might you adjust the word choice to use inclusive, non racially
        biased IT terminology?
      answer: >-
        A denylist refers to a list of banned persons or organizations.
  
        Do not use "blacklist" or "whitelist". These terms are based on a bad/good
        binary where black is represented as bad whereas white is represented as good,
        and so they promote racial bias. Instead of "blacklist", use "denylist" or
        "blocklist".
    - context: A black hat hacker exploits well-known vulnerabilities in systems to
        uncover sensitive information for personal gain or to inflict damage on
        the target system or network.
      question: How might you improve this sentence to use more inclusive, non
        racially biased IT terminology?
      answer: >-
        An attacker exploits well-known vulnerabilities in systems to uncover
        sensitive information for personal gain or to inflict damage on the target
        system or network.
  
        Do not use "black hat" or "white hat". These terms promote racial bias because
        black is used to indicate malevolence whereas white is used to indicate ethical,
        positive behavior. Instead of "black hat", use "attacker" or "unethical hacker".
    - context: A white hat hacker tests networks and systems to examine their
        performance and determine how vulnerable they are to intrusion. Academic
        researchers and professional security consultants are examples of white
        hat hackers.
      question: How might you adjust this sentence to use more inclusive, non racially
        biased IT terminology?
      answer: >-
        An ethical hacker tests networks and systems to examine their
        performance and determine how vulnerable they are to intrusion. Academic
        researchers and professional security consultants are examples of ethical
        hackers.
  
        Do not use "white hat" or "black hat". These terms promote racial bias because
        white is used to indicate ethical, positive behavior whereas black is used to
        indicate malevolence. Instead of "white hat", use "ethical hacker" or another
        term.
    - context: A use for whitelists is in local area network (LAN) security. Many
        network administrators set up MAC address whitelists, or a MAC address
        filter, to control who is allowed on their networks.
      question: How might you revise this sentence to use inclusive, non racially
        biased IT terminology?
      answer: >-
        A use for allowlists is in local area network (LAN) security. Many
        network administrators set up MAC address allowlists, or a MAC address
        filter, to control who is allowed on their networks.
  
        Do not use "whitelist" or "blacklist". These terms are based on a good/bad
        binary where white is represented as good whereas black is represented as bad,
        and so they promote racial bias. Instead of "whitelist", use "allowlist".
