task_description: You are a member of a team with a mission to create the
  conditions for belonging and inclusion in the workplace. The people whom you
  support are new to principles of inclusion and need a safe place to fail. This
  skill helps the writer use more inclusive terminology to avoid gender bias.
seed_examples:
  - context: Bad guys can exploit vulnerabilities or manipulate systems to steal
      personal information.
    question: How would you improve this sentence to use more inclusive,
      non-gendered IT terminology?
    answer: >-
      Bad actors can exploit vulnerabilities or manipulate systems to steal
      personal information.

      Avoid a gendered term. Use "bad actor" instead.
  - context: Welcome to the event, guys and girls.
    question: HHow would you rewrite this sentence to use more Inclusive,
      non-gendered IT terminology?
    answer: >-
      Welcome to the event, everyone.

      Using this term to address a group of people is problematic, because those
      who are not male might feel excluded. Using "guys and girls" in a business
      context is also problematic, because "girls" is not an appropriate way to
      refer to adult women. Alternatives might be "folks" or "all" or "everyone".
  - context: Each student must bring his own laptop to the training class.
    question: How would you adjust this sentence to use more inclusive, non-gendered
      IT terminology?
    answer: >-
      All students must bring their own laptop to the training class.

      Except when referring to a specific named person, do not assume that the
      subject of a sentence is of a particular gender.
  - context: The range of electronics components includes male and female connectors.
    question: How would you rewrite this sentence to use more inclusive,
      non-gendered IT terminology?
    answer: >-
      The range of electronics components includes plugs and sockets.

      In an electrical context, use non-gendered terms to refer to components,
      such as "plug", "pin", or "prong" instead of "male connector", and "receptacle",
      "socket", or "slot" instead of "female connector".
  - context: Manning levels have reduced by 40% since March.
    question: How would you revise this sentence to use more inclusive, non-gendered
      IT terminology?
    answer: >-
      Staffing levels have reduced by 40% since March.

      Instead of "man" or "manning", use a non-gendered term, such as "staffing",
      "covering", "monitoring", or "operating".
  - context: This activity requires 10 man days of effort.
    question: How would you adjust this sentence to use more Inclusive, non-gendered
      IT terminology?
    answer: |-
      This activity requires 10 person days of effort.
      Do not use "man day". Use "person day".
  - context: Completing the project on time requires a significant increase in man
      hours.
    question: How would you improve this sentence to use more Inclusive,
      non-gendered IT terminology?
    answer: >-
      Completing the project on time requires a significant increase in labor
      hours.

      Do not use "man hour". Use "labor hour" or "person hour".
  - context: A man-in-the-middle attack occurs when an attacker secretly intercepts
      and relays communications between two systems or people who believe that
      they are communicating directly with each other.
    question: How would you revise this sentence to use more Inclusive, non-gendered
      IT terminology?
    answer: >-
      An interceptor attack occurs when an attacker secretly intercepts and
      relays communications between two systems or people who believe that they
      are communicating directly with each other.

      Avoid gendered language, which can perpetuate bias and stereotypes, and might
      imply that women do not have the skills to perpetrate this type of hacking.
      Consider using a replacement term, such as "interceptor attack",
      "adversary-in-the-middle attack", or "intermediary attack".
