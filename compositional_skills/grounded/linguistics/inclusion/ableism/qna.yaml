      to avoid any offence to blind people?
    answer: >-
      It is important to consider the areas of weakness that your organization
      might have.

      Avoid "blind spot" in metaphorical use because of possible offence to blind people.
      Alternatives might be "unseen issue", "unknown obstacle", "something that gets
      ignored", or "area of weakness".

      to avoid any offence to people with a mental health condition?
    answer: >-
      You could be forgiven for thinking it surprising that Microsoft SQL
      Server runs on Linux.

      To avoid association with mental health conditions, use an alternative such as
      "surprising" or "unpredictable".

      printing or the ability to save files are unavailable until the user

      The software has restricted functions, and some features of the program
      such as printing or the ability to save files are unavailable until the
      user purchases a registration key.

      Avoid using "cripple", "crippled", or "crippleware" in a computing context.
      These terms are pejorative for people with physical disabilities.
  - context: Avoid a tendency of decision paralysis when deciding on a solution.
    question: How would you adjust this sentence to use more inclusive terminology
      to avoid any offence to people with disabilities?
    answer: >-
      Avoid a tendency of overanalyzing or overthinking when deciding on a
      solution.

      To avoid association with physical disabilities, use other wording to refer
      to taking too long to decide on a solution, such as "overanalyzing", "overthinking",
      or "indecision".

    question: How would you adjust this sentence to use more inclusive terminology
      to avoid any offence to people with a mental health condition?
    answer: >-
      Get the product at an unusually low price!

      To avoid association with mental health conditions, use other wording to refer to
      either someone or something that is considered to be unique, passionate, or extreme,
      in a positive sense; or conversely in a negative sense to refer to an attempt to
      discredit or criticize particular ideas, beliefs, principles, or attitudes.
  - context: Run a sanity check on the software.
    question: How would you rewrite this sentence to use more inclusive terminology
      to avoid any offence to neurodiverse people?
    answer: >-
      Validate the software.

      Avoid "sanity check" or "sanity test", because those terms might be derogatory
      to neurodiverse people, and are difficult to translate. Explain exactly what
      you mean. Consider alternatives such as using "check" alone, or "validate",
      "verify", "quick check", "coherence check", or "confidence check".
  - context: Run a sanity test on the software.
    question: How would you improve this sentence to use more inclusive terminology

      Avoid "sanity test" or "sanity check", because those terms might be derogatory
      to neurodiverse people, and are difficult to translate. Explain exactly what
      you mean. Consider alternatives such as using "test" alone, or "validate",
      "verify", "quick check", "coherence check", or "confidence check".
