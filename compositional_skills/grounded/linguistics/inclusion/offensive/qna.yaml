task_description: You are a member of a team with a mission to create the
  conditions for belonging and inclusion in the workplace. The people whom you
  support are new to principles of inclusion and need a safe place to fail. This
  skill helps the writer use more inclusive terminology to avoid offensive
  language.
seed_examples:
  - context: You can abort a running task by pressing Ctrl+C.
    question: How might you modify this sentence to use more inclusive IT terminology?
    answer: >-
      You can end a running task by pressing Ctrl+C.

      Use "abort" only if the term is part of the existing product terminology.
      Otherwise, replace it with an alternative such as "cancel", "stop", "end",
      or "fail".
  - context: The manager decided to abort the project.
    question: How might you modify this sentence to use more inclusive IT Terminology?
    answer: >-
      The manager decided to stop the project.

      Use "abort" only if the term is part of the existing product terminology.
      Otherwise, replace it with an alternative such as "cancel", "stop", "end",
      or "fail".
  - context: The kernel component contains the main binary files and ancillary
      utilities.
    question: How might you modify this sentence to use more inclusive terminology?
    answer: >-
      The kernel component contains the main binary files and auxiliary
      utilities.

      Avoid "ancillary" because the term is derived from the Latin for "slave-girl/maid".
      Use an alternative such as "auxiliary", "supplementary", "supporting",
      "subordinate", or "subsidiary".
  - context: A cabal was set up to investigate and report on the matter.
    question: How might you reword this sentence to use more inclusive, less
      offensive terminology?
    answer: >-
      A working group was set up to investigate and report on the matter.

      The connotation is of secret groups of powerful people who coordinate domination.
      Do not use "cabal"; use alternative terms to refer to a group of people.
  - context: The project team scheduled a session for grooming the product backlog
      to prioritize tasks for the next sprint.
    question: How might you rewrite this sentence to use more inclusive, less
      offensive terminology?
    answer: >-
      The project team scheduled a session for refining the product backlog to
      prioritize tasks for the next sprint.

      Use "refine" rather than "groom" to refer to a Scrum product backlog.
