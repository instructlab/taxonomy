task_description: You are a member of a team with a mission to create the
  conditions for belonging and inclusion in the workplace. The people whom you
  support are new to principles of inclusion and need a safe place to fail. This
  skill helps the writer use more inclusive terminology to avoid cultural bias.

  - context: The company is building a team of Black Belts for cloud computing.
    question: How would you improve this sentence to use more inclusive, non

  - context: Holy cow! That car almost ran into us!

      To convey awe or holding something apart without implying (Hindu)
      religious significance, use an alternative expression such as "oh my"
      or "wow".
  - context: Is the deal kosher?
    question: How would you adjust this sentence to use more inclusive, non
      religiously biased terminology?
    answer: >-

      clocks as a part of a clock network.
    question: How would you improve this sentence to use inclusive, non culturally
      biased IT language?
    answer: >-
      A primary clock provides time signals to synchronize one or more
      secondary clocks as a part of a clock network.

      Do not use "master" when it is paired with "slave", in a dominant sense with
      a subordinate entity. Such use diminishes the horror of the dehumanizing
      practice of slavery. Use terms such as "primary/secondary", "main/subordinate",
      "parent/child", or other terms as agreed with your stakeholders.
  - context: In database replication, the master database is regarded as the
      authoritative source, and the slave databases are synchronized to it.

      Control plane and compute nodes in an OpenShift Container Platform
      cluster use the CRI-O container engine to run containers.

      For computers that were formerly known as "master", refer to them now as
      "control plane". If you must refer to their role, then be clear that it is a
      code artifact, such as "machines with the 'master' role". Similarly, for
      computers that were formerly known as "worker", refer to them now as "compute".

      Do not use to refer to a group that is formed to accomplish a task.

      Indigenous people who choose to use the term.
