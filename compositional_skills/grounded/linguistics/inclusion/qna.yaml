      An attacker exploits well-known vulnerabilities in systems to uncover
      sensitive information for personal gain or to inflict damage on the target
      system or network.

      Use "unethical hacker" or "attacker". The terms "black hat" and "white
      hat" promote racial bias because black is used to indicate malevolence
      while white indicates ethical, positive behavior.
  - context: >-
      A white hat hacker tests networks and systems to examine their performance
      and determine how vulnerable they are to intrusion. Academic researchers
      and professional security consultants are examples of white hat hackers.

      The range of electronics components includes plugs and sockets.

      In an electrical context, use non-gendered terms to refer to components,
      such as "plug", "pin", or "prong" instead of "male connector", and
      "receptacle", "socket", or "slot" instead of "female connector".

      A man-in-the-middle attack occurs when an attacker secretly intercepts and
      relays communications between two systems or people who believe that they
      are communicating directly with each other.

    answer: >-
      An interceptor attack occurs when an attacker secretly intercepts and
      relays communications between two systems or people who believe that they
      are communicating directly with each other.

      Avoid gendered language, which can perpetuate bias and stereotypes, and
      might imply that women do not have the skills to perpetrate this type of
      hacking.

      Consider using a replacement term, such as "adversary-in-the-middle
      attack", "interceptor attack", or "intermediary attack".

      alone, or "validate", "verify", "quick check", "coherence check", or
      "confidence check".

      cluster and is part of a cluster's fencing strategy.
    question: How would you adjust this sentence to use more inclusive IT Terminology?
    answer: >-
      Fencing failed nodes helps to maintain the integrity of nodes in a
      high-availability cluster and is part of a cluster's fencing strategy.

      STONITH stands for "Shoot the Offending Node in the Head".

      Avoid such a graphically violent term. Instead, explain the relevant
      feature, such as "fencing failed nodes", "power management", or "power
      fencing".
