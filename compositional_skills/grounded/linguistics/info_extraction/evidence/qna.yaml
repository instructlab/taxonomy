    THE FOUNDATION INCUBATOR

    To support and encourage new projects, the ASF created the Incubator
    to help new efforts join the foundation.

    Since the meritocratic rules operate across the ASF from bottom to top,
    it is vital for the long-term stability of this form of government
    that a project's initial set of committers has to understand very well
    the dynamics of such a system, and to share the same philosophical attitude
    toward collaboration and openness that the ASF expects from its projects.

    The incubator is responsible for:

    * filtering proposals about the creation of a new project or sub-project

    * helping create the new project and the infrastructure that it needs to operate

    * supervising and mentoring the incubated community to help it create an open,
    meritocratic environment

    * evaluating the maturity of the incubated project, and deciding whether to
    promote it to official project / sub-project status or, in case of failure,
    to retire it.

    The incubator (like the board) does not perform filtering on the basis of
    technical issues. The foundation respects and supports a variety of technical
    approaches. It doesn't fear innovation or even internal confrontation between
    projects which overlap in functionality.

    The incubator filters projects on the basis of the likelihood of projects becoming
    successful meritocratic communities. The basic requirements for incubation are:

    * a working codebase -- over the years and after several failures, the foundation
    came to understand that without an initial working codebase, it is generally hard
    to bootstrap a community. This is because merit is not well-recognized by
    developers without a working codebase. Also, the friction that can develop during
    the initial design stage is likely to fragment the community.

    * the intention to assign sufficient intellectual property rights to the software
    to the ASF -- this allows the foundation to obtain an irrevocable and permanent
    right to redistribute and work on the code, without fearing lock-in for itself
    or for its users, while still allowing the original author to maintain their copyright.

    * a sponsoring ASF member or officer -- this person acts as the main mentor,
    giving directions to the project, helping out in the day-to-day details and
    keeping contact with the incubator PMC.

    The incubation period normally serves to estimate whether the project is able
    to increase the diversity of its committer base and play within the meritocratic
    rules of the foundation.

    It might seem rather easy to achieve, but, in a volunteer and highly selective
    environment, attracting new committers is not automatic.

    Diversity of committership is important for two main reasons:

    * it gives long term stability to the project's development. In fact, with
    all the developers affiliated to the same entity, the chance of seeing all
    of them moving away from the project at the same time is much greater than
    with a community of individuals affiliated to unrelated entities.

    * it gives a greater variety of technical visions, This guarantees a better
    adherence to the environment and users' needs, thus a higher chance of finding
    real-life use of the software.

    Site Policy on GitHub

    The universe of policies and procedures that govern the use of GitHub,
    open-sourced for your use and inspiration. We created this repository
    as a place for people to fork, contribute to, and provide feedback on
    our policies. While this is our official repo of open-sourced policies,
    it may not reflect the exact policies that are live on GitHub because
    this site is updated separately from the Help site.

    What can I do here?

    First, you can use and adapt our policies!

    We are proud to offer the policies in this repository under CC0-1.0.
    That means that if any of them are useful to you, even in part, you're
    welcome to use them, without restriction. Of course, keep in mind that
    we wrote these policies as they apply to GitHub, so you'll need to
    make sure the content applies to what you're using it for, and adapt
    it as appropriate. See the license section for use guidelines.

    Because we are providing these policies to our community, we believe
    it is only responsible to also provide the history and insight that
    a repository of commits, pull requests, and issues can offer. Over
    time, the repository's commits, pull requests, and issues will allow
    anyone wanting to use our policies to see the discussions and
    alterations that have gone into them.

    Second, you can contribute to making our policies even better.

    We host collaborative development on GitHub's site policies, procedures,
    and guidelines here. That means you're welcome to provide feedback via
    a pull request or by opening an issue. When opening an issue, please
    look over the Contribution Guidelines. This will help us respond to your
    concern more quickly.

    That seems like great power! What about the great responsibility?

    That's easy: just be responsible. Follow our Code of Conduct, and help
    us maintain a respectful environment for all contributors.

    There are a few things you should not post in this repository:

    * Please don't post legal complaints or ask for technical support.
    We may not respond to issues promptly. If you need help, contact Support
    and they'll get you an answer.

    * Please avoid hypotheticals. We can't give you legal advice, which
    means we often can't tell you if a hypothetical situation would or
    wouldn't be a violation of our policies. We also can't tell you what
    you should or shouldn't do. We can tell you how we interpret our policies.

    * Please don't give other users legal advice, to avoid confusion.

    The El Dorado County Library immediately put its 3-D printers to work
    creating masks and face shields for healthcare workers. By early April 2020,
    they had formed a partnership with a local pharmaceutical startup to help
    produce and distribute thousands of face shields to local medical personnel
    and frontline workers. By October, the library was also partnering with
    the El Dorado County Registrar of Voters to provide more face shields
    to poll workers, as well as hosting a voting center and drive-up ballot
    collection boxes at branches countywide.

    The library distributes free food, diapers, and other essentials in partnership
    with the Placer Food Bank, El Dorado Community Foundation, and
    First 5 El Dorado Commission. Library staff also help community members
    register for vaccine appointments online. Many in the county do not have
    computers or access to the internet. The library received 200 calls and
    had dozens of people waiting at the library doors in the first three hours
    of offering this service.

    This publication explains how individuals claim a deduction for charitable
    contributions. It discusses the types of organizations to which you can make
    deductible charitable contributions and the types of contributions you can
    deduct. It also discusses how much you can deduct, what records you must keep,
    and how to report charitable contributions.

    A charitable contribution is a donation or gift to, or for the use of, a
    qualified organization. It is voluntary and is made without getting, or
    expecting to get, anything of equal value.

    Qualified organizations. Qualified organizations include nonprofit groups
    that are religious, charitable, educational, scientific, or literary in purpose,
    or that work to prevent cruelty to children or animals. You will find
    descriptions of these organizations under Organizations That Qualify To
    Receive Deductible Contributions.

    Schedule A (Form 1040) required. Generally, to deduct a charitable contribution,
    you must itemize deductions on Schedule A (Form 1040). The amount of your
    deduction may be limited if certain rules and limits explained in this
    publication apply to you.

    Feature Summary

    The following are the key features of Maven in a nutshell:

    * Simple project setup that follows best practices - get a new project
    or module started in seconds

    * Consistent usage across all projects - means no ramp up time for new
    developers coming onto a project

    * Superior dependency management including automatic updating,
    dependency closures (also known as transitive dependencies)

    * Able to easily work with multiple projects at the same time

    * A large and growing repository of libraries and metadata to use out
    of the box, and arrangements in place with the largest Open Source
    projects for real-time availability of their latest releases

    * Extensible, with the ability to easily write plugins in Java or
    scripting languages

    * Instant access to new features with little or no extra configuration

    * Ant tasks for dependency management and deployment outside of Maven

    * Model based builds: Maven is able to build any number of projects
    into predefined output types such as a JAR, WAR, or distribution based
    on metadata about the project, without the need to do any scripting in
    most cases.

    * Coherent site of project information: Using the same metadata as for
    the build process, Maven is able to generate a web site or PDF
    including any documentation you care to add, and adds to that standard
    reports about the state of development of the project. Examples of this
    information can be seen at the bottom of the left-hand navigation of
    this site under the "Project Information" and "Project Reports" submenus.

    * Release management and distribution publication: Without much
    additional configuration, Maven will integrate with your source control
    system (such as Subversion or Git) and manage the release of a project
    based on a certain tag. It can also publish this to a distribution
    location for use by other projects. Maven is able to publish individual
    outputs such as a JAR, an archive including other dependencies and
    documentation, or as a source distribution.

    * Dependency management: Maven encourages the use of a central repository
    of JARs and other dependencies. Maven comes with a mechanism that your
    project's clients can use to download any JARs required for building your
    project from a central JAR repository much like Perl's CPAN. This allows
    users of Maven to reuse JARs across projects and encourages communication
    between projects to ensure that backward compatibility issues are dealt with.
