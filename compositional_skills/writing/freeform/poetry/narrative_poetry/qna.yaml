- answer: 'In the heart of the valley, where time''s river flows,

    Stands a solitary tree, in repose.

    A sentinel of seasons, a witness to change,

    In the dance of the years, it has been entranced.


    Once, it was a sapling, in a forest so grand,

    Where the world was a canvas, and life was unplanned.

    Now it stands alone, in the clearing it''s made,

    A testament to time, in the landscape it''s laid.


    Through the centuries, it has seen the sun rise and set,

    In its silence, it has not forgotten or regretted.

    It has watched the seasons, in their endless play,

    The winter''s chill, the summer''s blaze, the spring''s sweet serenade, the autumn''s
    gentle ballet.


    It has seen the rivers shift their course,

    And the hills, once distant, draw near with force.

    It has watched the forests rise and fall,

    And the meadows bloom and then withdraw.


    It has felt the tremors of the earth''s delight,

    And the shuddering cries in the dead of the night.

    It has seen the stars in their celestial play,

    And the moon''s soft glow in the quiet of the day.


    It has provided shelter to the creatures of the wood,

    And seen them come and go, as they understood.

    It has been a beacon, a friend, a guide,

    In the landscape of change, it has stood with pride.


    And as it stands, in its solitary might,

    It carries the stories of a thousand sights.

    A silent witness, a timeless sprite,

    In the heart of the valley, under the soft moonlight.'
