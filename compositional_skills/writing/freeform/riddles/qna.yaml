      Initially, there are 10 passengers on the bus. At the first stop, 4
      passengers get off, so there are (10 - 4 = 6) passengers on the bus.
      Additionally, 3 passengers get on, bringing the total to 6+3=9 passengers.
      At the second stop, 3 passengers get off, leaving (9 − 3 = 6) passengers

      Starting on the ground floor, 7 people enter the elevator, so initially,
      there are 7 people in the elevator. On second floor 3 people get off, so
      (7 − 3 = 4) people remain. Additionally, 2 people enter, bringing the
      total to 4+2=6 people. On fourth floor, 5 people get off, so (6 − 5 = 1)
      person remains. Also, 2 people enter, making the total 1+2=3 people. On
      seventh floor, 1 person gets off, leaving (3 − 1 = 2) people. Furthermore,
      3 people enter, resulting in 2+3=5 people. On tenth floor, all remaining
      passengers, which is 5 people, get off. So the answer is,there were 7
      people when the journey started and a total of 14 (3 people at the second
      floor, 5 people at the fourth floor, 1 person at the seventh floor, and 5
      people at the tenth floor) people exited by the end of the journey.
