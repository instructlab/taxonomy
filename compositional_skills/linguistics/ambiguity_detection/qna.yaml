task_description: >

    to conclude the claim. Pay attention to ambiguities in the passage,
    such as unresolved pronouns, missing values, and phrases with many
    possible interpretations.

- context: >
    Passage:

    This model of XYZ is compatible with Product ABC and Product DEF.

    Claim:

    Model M1 of accessory XYZ only works with Product ABC and Product DEF.
  question: >
    Is Passage sufficient to conclude Claim?
  answer: >
    No, the passage is not sufficient to conclude the claim. The claim is
    about model M1 of accessory XYZ, but the passage does not mention
    model M1 of accessory XYZ. Phrase "This model of XYZ" in the passage
    can refer to a different model of XYZ, not necessarily to model M1.

    Passage:

    You can avoid the monthly service fee for ABC Checking Account if you
    maintain at least $500 minimum daily balance.

    Claim:

    ABC Checking Account has a monthly service fee of $10.
  question: >
    Is Passage sufficient to conclude Claim?
  answer: >
    No, the passage is not sufficient to conclude the claim. The claim
    states that ABC Checking Account's monthly service fee is $10, but
    the passage does not mention the fee's amount in any way.

    Passage:

    What I saw today was the most wonderful and magnificent thing I have ever witnessed.

    Claim:

    Today's solar eclipse has made a strong impression on me.
  question: >
    Is Passage sufficient to conclude Claim?
  answer: >
    No, the passage is not sufficient to conclude the claim. The claim
    is about a solar eclipse, but the passage makes no mention of a
    solar eclipse. Phrases "What I saw today" and "the most wonderful
    and magnificent thing" in the passage could refer to many different
    things or phenomena, for example to a rocket launch or a blooming
    meadow; we cannot conclude that they must refer to a solar eclipse.

    Passage:

    Many tech stocks have been doing really well last week, with XYZ Technologies
    growing at breakneck pace.

    Claim:

    The shares of XYZ Technologies grew by more than 300% by the end of last week.
  question: >
    Is Passage sufficient to conclude Claim?
  answer: >
    No, the passage is not sufficient to conclude the claim. The claim states that
    the shares of XYZ Technologies grew by more than 300%, but the passage makes
    no mention of a growth rate above 300%. Phrase "growing at breakneck pace" in
    the passage is subjective and does not represent any specific number or range.

    Passage:

    One of its key features is the ability to easily work with multiple
    projects at the same time.

    Claim:

    Maven is able to easily work with multiple projects at the same time.
  question: >
    Is Passage sufficient to conclude Claim?
  answer: >
    No, the passage is not sufficient to conclude the claim. The claim is
    about Maven, but the passage does not mention Maven. Pronoun "its" in
    the passage can refer to anything, not necessarily to Maven.
