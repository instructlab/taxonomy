    \ receiving monitors. On Dec 2$^{nd,}$ 2023, I started the process of purchasing\
    \ 7 high-def Samsung monitors for the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab. I think you already\
    \ know, but I wanted to outline the steps needed to make this purchase.\n\n1.\

    \ from Line VP\n\n4. Submit an Ad Hoc request to Procurement\n\n5. Approval from\

    \ needed to execute the order\n\n11. Monitors are then shipped to our location\n\
    \nWe have now finally reached number 11 in this process. Below I wanted to outline\
    \ what we are receiving and when they are expected to arrive.\n\n| Monitor\_\_\
