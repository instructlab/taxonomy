  - question: |
      Can you generate a table in asciidoc format, with a column listing the days of the week, and a second column that
      just contains the first letter in the corresponding day name?

    answer: |
      I'm glad to help! Here's the AsciiDoc code for a table with the days of the week and their corresponding first
      letters:

      .Table: Days of the Week - First Letter
      [%header]
      |===
      | Days      | First Letter
      | Monday    | M
      | Tuesday   | T
      | Wednesday | W
      | Thursday  | Th or T
      | Friday    | F
      | Saturday  | S
      | Sunday    | Su or S
      |===

      This is just one example of how to achieve this task using AsciiDoc tables. There are many variations possible
      depending on the specific requirements or preferences of the user.

  - question: |
      Generate an Asciidoc table with a column for the colours pink, brown, and orange, and another column containing a
      hexcode for the corresponding colour in that row

    answer: |
      Here's the asciidoc code for the desired table:

      .Table: Colours - Hex Codes)
      |===
      | Colours | Hex Codes
      | Pink    | #FFC0CB
      | Brown   | #A52A2A
      | Orange  | #FFA500
      |===

  - question: |
      Create an asciidoc table containing a numbered list of the first 10 elements in the periodic table, along with
      their respective atomic number, atomic mass, and standard state.

    answer: |
      Here's the asciidoc code for the desired table:

      .First 10 elements: atomic number, atomic mass, standard state
      [%header]
      |===
      | Element | Atomic Number | Atomic Mass | Standard State
      | H       | 1             | 1.008       | gas
      | He      | 2             | 4.003       | gas
      | Li      | 3             | 6.941       | solid
      | Be      | 4             | 9.012       | solid
      | B       | 5             | 10.81       | solid
      | C       | 6             | 12.01       | solid
      | N       | 7             | 14.007      | gas
      | O       | 8             | 15.999      | gas
      | F       | 9             | 18.998      | gas
      | Ne      | 10            | 20.18       | gas

  - question: |
      Please recreate the following markdown table in Asciidoc format:

      | Food Name | Type      | Color  |
      | --------- | --------- | ------ |
      | Chicken   | Meat      | White  |
      | Carrot    | Vegetable | Orange |
      | Ham       | Meat      | Pink   |

    answer: |
      Here is the corresponding AsciiDoc equivalent of the table:

      .Table of food names, types, and colors
      [%header]
      |===
      | Food Name | Type      | Color
      | Chicken   | Meat      | White
      | Carrot    | Vegetable | Orange
      | Ham       | Meat      | Pink
      |===

      Note that where Markdown has a delimiting line between the column headers and the row cells, the AsciiDoc version
      instead uses the [%header] option before the rows to indicate that the first row contains the column headers. The
      table contents are contained between the "|===" lines.

  - question: |
      I've got this Markdown table that I'd like converted to AsciiDoc, is that something that you could help with?

      | Cardinal Number | Spelling | Ordinal Equivalent | Ordinal Spelling |
      |-----------------|-----------|--------------------|-----------------|
      | 1               | One       | 1st                | First           |
      | 2               | Two       | 2nd                | Second          |
      | 3               | Three     | 3rd                | Third           |
      | 4               | Four      | 4th                | Fourth          |
      | 5               | Five      | 5th                | Fifth           |
      | 6               | Six       | 6th                | Sixth           |
      | 7               | Seven     | 7th                | Seventh         |
      | 8               | Eight     | 8th                | Eighth          |

    answer: |
      Here's the AsciiDoc equivalent of the table:

      .Table of cardinal and ordinal numbers
      [%header]
      |===
      | Cardinal Number | Spelling | Ordinal Equivalent | Ordinal Spelling
      | 1               | One      | 1st                | First
      | 2               | Two      | 2nd                | Second
      | 3               | Three    | 3rd                | Third
      | 4               | Four     | 4th                | Fourth
      | 5               | Five     | 5th                | Fifth
      | 6               | Six      | 6th                | Sixth
      | 7               | Seven    | 7th                | Seventh
      | 8               | Eight    | 8th                | Eighth
      |===

      This is one way to encode the table in AsciiDoc. There are other options that can be used to customize how the
      table is displayed when rendered.
