- answer: "[5,1,3]"
  context: This science fiction movie released on July 5, 2021, was phenomenal. The
    special effects, the acting, the plot - everything was top-notch.\n2. Never before
    have I been so disappointed with a movie. The plot was predictable, and the characters
    were one-dimensional. In my opinion, this movie is the worst one to have been
    released in 2022.\n3. The movie was okay. There were some parts I enjoyed, but
    there were also parts that felt lackluster. This is a movie that was released
    in March 2019 and seems to be quite ordinary.

    negative, 3 being neutral, and 5 being very positive. Return the answer as a JSON
    array of integers.
