task_description: >-
    Can classify the error output message by code language, out of Python,
    Ansible, Bash, and Go.
    Languages seletion classification group selected from the most prominent
    languages used in the Openstack & Openshift space.
    Iput would be a raw string error message sentence, with a question "In what
    coding lenguage is this error message, what does it mean ?"
    Output will be the probable language used and a short explanation of the
    error.
