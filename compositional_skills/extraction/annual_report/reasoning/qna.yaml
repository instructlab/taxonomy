    \nOur business profile positions us well in challenging times. Our diversification\

    \ 3.2 points in the second half of 2022 compared to the first half reflecting\
    \ the benefit of these actions. Additionally, across all of our product-based\
    \ businesses, we have executed price increases above our historical level of increases\
    \ to be more reflective of the labor and component costs we are incurring due\

    \ chain has demonstrated resiliency and the ability to proactively respond to\
