  - answer: "Run yum install python3-devel. If that doesn't work, try to update your GCC version."
    question: >
      Please read the following pip error output information and offer a solution:

        Could not find <Python.h>. This could mean the following:
        * You're on Ubuntu and haven't run `apt-get install python3-dev`.
        * You're on RHEL/Fedora and haven't run `yum install python3-devel` or
          `dnf install python3-devel` (make sure you also have redhat-rpm-config
          installed)
        * You're on Mac OS X and the usual Python framework was somehow corrupted
          (check your environment variables or try re-installing?)
        * You're on Windows and your Python installation was somehow corrupted
          (check your environment variables or try re-installing?)

      Please offer a solution to the error message in the following log:

      CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:271 (find_package):
      By not providing "FindArrow.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
      asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "Arrow", but
      CMake did not find one.
      
      Could not find a package configuration file provided by "Arrow" with any of
      the following names:
      
        ArrowConfig.cmake
        arrow-config.cmake
      
      Add the installation prefix of "Arrow" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
      "Arrow_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "Arrow"
      provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
      installed.
