      Working in the IT sector requires adeptness with various technologies and methodologies. From utilizing SDLC 
      (Software Development Life Cycle) to manage projects efficiently, 
      to implementing CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipelines for automated 
      testing and deployment, these practices streamline development workflows. Engaging with APIs 
      (Application Programming Interfaces) facilitates seamless integration between systems, while leveraging AWS 
      (Amazon Web Services) or GCP (Google Cloud Platform) provides scalable infrastructure solutions. 
      Employing DevOps principles, such as IaC (Infrastructure as Code) and Agile methodologies, fosters collaboration and 
      innovation within cross-functional teams, ensuring the delivery of high-quality software products.
    question: |
      Which acronyms cold you find in the text?
    answer: |
      SDLC - Software Development Life Cycle
      CI/CD - Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment
      APIs - Application Programming Interfaces
      AWS - Amazon Web Services
      GCP - Google Cloud Platform
      IaC - Infrastructure as Code

      Black holes (BHs) are cosmic entities with gravitational fields so intense that not even light can escape. They form from the collapse of massive stars, resulting in a singularity a point of infinite density.
      A defining feature of BHs is their event horizon (EH), marking the boundary beyond which nothing can return, known as the Schwarzschild radius (SR).
      As matter spirals into a BH, it forms an accretion disk - a swirling mass of gas and dust emitting intense radiation.
      BHs also generate jets of matter and energy from their ergosphere, a region where space and time are dragged along with the BH's rotation.
      Understanding BHs involves navigating complex concepts like general relativity (GR) and quantum mechanics (QM), challenging physicists to unify these theories into a single framework of quantum gravity.
    question: |
      Provide me the list of acronyms that you found
    answer: |
      BHs - Black Holes
      EH - Event Horizon
      SR - Schwarzschild Radius
      GR - General Relativity
      QM - Quantum Mechanics
