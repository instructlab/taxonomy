- answer: 'The approach described in the paper has three key advantages compared to
    related work in this space. First, the underlying generation mechanism is efficient
    and extensible as it leverages a single synthetic dataset that can be quickly
    post-processed for multiple different needs. Second, it is highly scalable and
    can work well on large datasets. Third, the quality of the generated synthetic
    data is evaluated on more stringent and realistic evaluation data than existing
    methods.

    \ synthetic data using DP mechanisms is an active area of research [see e.g.,\
    \ HLM12, BLR13, GAH + 14, CXZX15, BSG17, AZK + 19, UV20, GMHI20, TMH + 21, VAA\

    \ methods [VTB + 20, ABK + 21, MMSM22, LVW21], which aim to ensure that the synthetic\
    \ data perform well on a collection of queries. Our work differs in three key\
    \ features. First, all existing approaches focus on generating private synthetic\
    \ data from scratch, while we aim to post-process synthetic data to downweight\
    \ samples that do not accurately represent the real data under the specified utility\
    \ measures. As a result, our approach is more efficient as it does not need to\
    \ fit a graphical model [MMSM22] or a neural network [LVW21] to represent the\
    \ data distribution, and it is more extendable, allowing a single synthetic dataset\
    \ to be quickly post-processed multiple times for different sets of utility measures\
    \ as needed by downstream users. Second, some existing work may not scale well\
    \ to large datasets as they either require solving an integer program multiple\
    \ times [VTB + 20] or need to solve a large-scale optimization problem [ABK +\
    \ 21]. In contrast, our approach is highly scalable, as it only requires solving\
    \ a convex program whose number of variables is equal to the number of specified\
    \ utility measures. Third, existing work often evaluates the quality of the synthetic\
    \ data by how well it preserves key statistics (e.g., 3-way marginals) of the\
    \ real data. In contrast, in our experiments, we evaluate our approach on the\
    \ more stringent and realistic test of training various downstream ML models on\
    \ the synthetic data and measuring their performance on real test data. The experimental\
    \ results demonstrate that our approach can enhance the utility of synthetic data\

    \ procedure for improving the utility of a given synthetic dataset based on selected\

    \ available datasets. In this regard, this work is related to public-data-assisted\
    \ methods [see e.g., LVS + 21, LVW21], which leverage public data for saving privacy\
    \ budgets. We extend Algorithm 1 in [LVS + 21] by formalizing the preservation\
    \ of (noisy) utility measures as a constrained optimization problem, rather than\
    \ minimizing the corresponding Lagrangian function. We further establish strong\
    \ duality and propose a stochastic first-order method for solving this constrained\
    \ optimization efficiently. We extend Algorithm 4 in [LVW21] by allowing any non-negative\
    \ violation tolerance (i.e., any \u03B3 \u2265 0 in (3b)) compared with \u03B3\
    \ = 0 in [LVW21]. This extension offers increased flexibility, as users can now\
    \ select various values of \u03B3 to navigate the trade-off between minimizing\

    \ measures. Moreover, our experiments show that setting \u03B3 to be a small positive\

    \ tabular data, as evidenced by benchmark experiments in [TMH + 21]. Our experiments\
