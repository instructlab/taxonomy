  question: what is the design DeLorean  body is based on
- answer: |DeLoreans, early-production models in particular, suffered from poor build quality as well as mechanical issues. Early-production cars needed as much as 200 hours of work at DMC Quality Assurance Centers prior to being shipped to dealerships for delivery.[54] DMC eventually sent 30 factory workers to the quality centers in the US to learn about the problems and how to fix them.[54] Quality did improve over time, and by 1982 many of the quality issues had been resolved.[54] A total of four recalls were issued by the factory to correct problems such as a sticking throttle, front-suspension issues and an inertia switch.[55]
