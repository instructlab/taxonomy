- answer: 'When drying clothes outside, several factors can affect the drying time,
    such as temperature, humidity, wind, and the number of shirts.

    take as long as drying 5 shirts so 4 hours. However, when there''s only sufficient
    space for 5 shirts, you''ll need to dry the shirts in batches so considering that
    you need to dry 20 shirts, you would need 4 batches bringing the total time to
    16 hours.

- answer: 'Let''s analyze the situation step by step:


    1\. We know that 4 cars traveled from San Francisco to San Jose, which is 41.60
    miles apart.

    2\. Each car travels at a similar speed. Having more cars on the road will not
    reduce the time that any one car takes to drive from San Francisco to San Jose.

    3\. Therefore, the time it takes for each car to travel the distance is same,
    1 hour.
