    When drying clothes outside, several factors can affect the drying time, such as temperature, humidity, wind, and the number of shirts.
    If there's sufficient space for drying shirts in parallel, drying 20 shirts could take as long as drying 5 shirts so 4 hours. However, when there's only sufficient space for 5 shirts, you'll need to dry the shirts in batches so considering that you need to dry 20 shirts, you would need 4 batches bringing the total time to 16 hours.

  question: You're an expert in house chores. It takes 4 hours to dry 5 shirts in
    open air. How long does it take to dry 20 shirts?

    Let's analyze the situation step by step:

    1\. We know that 4 cars traveled from San Francisco to San Jose, which is 41.60 miles apart.
    2\. Each car travels at a similar speed. Having more cars on the road will not reduce the time that any one car takes to drive from San Francisco to San Jose.
    3\. Therefore, the time it takes for each car to travel the distance is same, 1 hour.
  question: "4 cars left San Fransisco at 12pm and they reached San Jose, 41.60 mi\
    \ apart, at 1pm. How much time will be needed for 8 cars? Consider they have similar\
    \ speed."

    Based on the information provided, we know that Jane has one car and that it is in the driveway when she is at home. However, when Jane is at her office, we know that she used her car for commuting. This implies that the car is not in the driveway. As Jane only has 1 car, then there must be no cars in Jane's driveway now.  Therefore the answer is 0.
  question: |
    Jane has 1 car. When she is at home then her car is in the driveway. Jane is now at her office. Can you find the  number of car in her driveway now?
