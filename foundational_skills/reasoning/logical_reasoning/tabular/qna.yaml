- answer: "To predict the next value in the temperature sequence, we can look at the\
    \ pattern in the previous values. The differences between consecutive temperatures\
    \ are:\n\n2 (day 2 - day 1)\n3 (day 3 - day 2)\n3 (day 4 - day 3)\n4 (day 5 -\
    \ day 4)\n\nThis increasing difference suggests that the temperature will continue\
    \ to increase. To find the next temperature, we can add the difference from day\
    \ 4 to the temperature of day 4:\n\nNext temperature = Day 4 temperature + Difference\n\
    = 28 \xB0C + 3 \xB0C\n= 31 \xB0C\n\nTherefore, the next value in the sequence\
    \ is 31 degrees Celsius.\n"

- answer: 'To calculate the total number of fruits bought on each day we first sum
    up the number of fruits bought in each day.

    Total fruits for A = 5 (Day 1) + 8 (Day 2) + 4 (Day 3) = 17

    Total fruits for B = 3 (Day 1) + 6 (Day 2) + 7 (Day 3) = 16

    Total fruits for C = 2 (Day 1) + 5 (Day 2) + 6 (Day 3) = 13


    Hence on Day 3 the lowest number of fruits were bought.

    '
  question: "Consider the following table representing the number of fruits bought\
    \ by three different people (A, B, C) at a fruit stall over three days (Day 1,\
    \ Day 2, Day 3):\n\nPerson\tDay 1\tDay 2\tDay 3\nA\t5\t8\t4\nB\t3\t6\t7\nC\t2\t\
