    To predict the next value in the temperature sequence, we can look at the pattern in the previous values. The differences between consecutive temperatures are:

    2 (day 2 - day 1)
    3 (day 3 - day 2)
    3 (day 4 - day 3)
    4 (day 5 - day 4)

    This increasing difference suggests that the temperature will continue to increase. To find the next temperature, we can add the difference from day 4 to the temperature of day 4:

    Next temperature = Day 4 temperature + Difference
    = 28 째C + 3 째C
    = 31 째C

    Therefore, the next value in the sequence is 31 degrees Celsius.
  question: "Given the following table, predict the next value in the sequence:\n\n\
    Day\tTemperature (째C)\n1\t20\n2\t22\n3\t25\n4\t28\n5\t?\n\n"

    To calculate the total number of fruits bought on each day we first sum up the number of fruits bought in each day.
    Total fruits for A = 5 (Day 1) + 8 (Day 2) + 4 (Day 3) = 17
    Total fruits for B = 3 (Day 1) + 6 (Day 2) + 7 (Day 3) = 16
    Total fruits for C = 2 (Day 1) + 5 (Day 2) + 6 (Day 3) = 13

    Hence on Day 3 the lowest number of fruits were bought.
  question: "Consider the following table representing the number of fruits bought\
    \ by three different people (A, B, C) at a fruit stall over three days (Day 1,\
    \ Day 2, Day 3):\n\nPerson\tDay 1\tDay 2\tDay 3\nA\t5\t8\t4\nB\t3\t6\t7\nC\t2\t\
    5\t6\nOn which day lowest number of fruits were brought?\n"
